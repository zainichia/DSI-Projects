3,"Are high speed high capacity  A1  A2  U3  microSD cards worth it for Android  With Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals coming up  I  re tested 5 of those and 2 older ones in 3 quite different Android phones After recently acquiring a 1TB microSD card in a pre Black Friday deal  I decided to re test  my collection  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a  of larger faster microSD cards  I have done Androbench memory benchmark posts before in  2019  https   www reddit com r lgv20 comments bpq09x fast_512gb_microsdcx_just_got_more_affordable   and  2018  https   www reddit com r lgv20 comments 9zgb18 benchmarking_fast_and_big_microsdxc_cards_in_the   using my LG V20  This time I was curious how much the Android phone s card reader and other hardware inside the phone affects the performance  So I tested them in phones that I have available to me 

  The 2020 Poco X3 NFC with the Snapdragon 732G  64GB model    more in  r PocoPhones

I already knew from those earlier tests that even the fastest microSD cards are notably slower than almost any phone s internal storage  However  for a lot of uses it can be good to store to and read from a microSD  Because it is expandable storage  keeping precious space free on the internal memory   but also because it is removable and thus replaceable  It is a way to preserve the non removable internal storage from unnecessary shenanigans causing wear  So using a microSD can help to keep an Android phone speedier  more space free on the internal storage means better performance  and make it last longer  so more endurance  less wear of the internal storage  

Testing took longer than I had anticipated  because I did some discoveries that made me run more follow up tests to figure out what was going on 

  TL DR   Most relevant findings

  Performance results of the most expensive A2 cards  like the Sandisk A2 Extreme PRO 1TB and Sandisk A2 Extreme 400GB  are not blowing away the usually less expensive Sandisk A1 cards and the Samsung U3 512GB card   However it can still be a good idea to pick up a higher rated card if the price difference is temporarily small during special offers  especially if you plan to later re use a high performance card in a DSLR or drone 
  I see some notable performance differences within the same product line  E g  significantly lower Sequential Write speeds on a brand new Sandisk A1 Ultra 64GB vs an older Sandisk A1 Ultra 400GB one 
  Between phones  clear trends can be seen with the same cards  especially when it comes to write speeds  sequential and random    also check the  gallery  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a  So this gives me the impression that results of certain cards in certain conditions  e g  free space  age  formatted  can be extrapolated between phones  taking some margins into account 
  Of the areas Androbench tests  Sequential Read speed  1st table  1st graph in  gallery  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a   is the most consistent between phones and cards  It s the most flat graphic  The Poco has the most consistent sequential read speeds between cards 
  I discovered that usage history and available space can have a significant impact on the results   this can be most clearly seen in  graph 05  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a  with the disappointing Sequential Write speeds in the Samsung EVO Select after using it in 3 devices  Performance was much better in May 2019 and most of it returned after freshly formatting before my latest tests  Take  graph 05 and 06  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a    table 5 and 6 below into account when looking at the Samsung EVO Select 512GB and the Sandisk A2 Extreme 400GB  I did not have time to redo all my tests in all phones after I did that discovery 
  The Poco X3 NFC which is  recommended  https   www reddit com r PocoPhones comments jpdgzr microsdxc_would_anyone_be_interested_in gbml3vr  to be used with 256GB max only had no problems with running tests on the bigger capacity cards  including the 1TB Sandisk  Note that I have not daily driven it with any of the larger cards in my wife s Poco

    Average       692   528 520 627 430 148 472 

  Random Write speeds   My takeaway     Medium range of results  472 692 IOPS  when just looking at the newer A1  A2 and Samsung cards  If you are using an older or no brand microSD card  you may want to run Androbench on it to see if there is anything to gain 

  SQL tests  notably higher ratings on the 2 newer phones  especially the Poco

Androbench also tests  SQL Ins  QPS   SQL Upd  QPS  and  SQL Del  QPS  during each full test  Detailed results for this can be found in the  Google Docs Sheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1wKrnEN2uqKXchg41qQkztyFfZjOokj1wrPkEE0n27RM edit usp sharing   The Poco X3 is the clear winner in this area  where some of the microSD cards even beat the Poco s Internal Storage  something that I had not seen before  The G8X follows the Poco at a distance and the two V20s lag behind in this area  This makes me believe that SoC power and SoC optimizations for SQL performance are a factor in this area 

  Trying to solve the mystery of variation in write speeds on two of the cards that I tested in 2018 and 2019

I had tested these cards already  in the V20 only

In the 2018 and 2019 overview benchmark posts  I had re used results from earlier tests  not really considering that test results could change over time  So this has really been the first time I structurally reviewed all cards at the same time 

During early November 7 9  2020  testing  with quite low 7  and 12  free space respectively   I noticed much lower results  especially with the Sequential Write scores 

After seeing that  I decided to free up some space  to 29  free  to check if this would give more similar results than what I had measured during the 2018 19 tests  I ran these tests on all four phones  The ones with 29  free is what you see in tables   graphs 01 through 04 

Not seeing any real improvements  I decided to do focused testing only on the V20  Oreo  

My first step  17 November  was to format the cards in the V20 and run benchmarks with 100  free space 

My next and final step  18 November  was re filling both cards and doing benchmark rounds

  Performance variation Samsung 512GB   My takeaway     Sequential Write speeds suffered a lot after 18 months of using in 3 different devices  Formatting the card  Nov 17  recovered most of the Sew Wr performance and recovered the Rnd Wr speed  Even after re filling the card Seq Wr and Rnd Wr stays good   Seq Rd performance seems to have dropped  based on available space  I wonder if I can reproduce that in future tests

  Performance variation Sandisk 2 400GB   My takeaway      This card was less intensively used than the Samsung  I did not use it so long in a daily driver device  Formatting the card did not really make a big change in Seq Wr and Rnd Wr performance  All Read and Write performances seem to go up and down more  based on available space 

  How I tested

  All numbers shown in the tables here are an   average of sets of 3 measurements    without cherry picking results   my raw test data can be found in the 5th through 8th tab in the  Google Docs Sheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1wKrnEN2uqKXchg41qQkztyFfZjOokj1wrPkEE0n27RM edit usp sharing  
  Room   temperature      in the frisky 17 19 Celsius  62 66 F  range in my case
    No case or skin      cases and skins can impact heat dissipation and thus SoC temperature and influence results
    Airplane mode ON      poor cellular  indoors  and Wifi reception can keep the SoC and battery busy  which can blur the results
    Localization  GPS  OFF      same reason as airplane mode
    Anti malware de installed      I had ESET Mobile Security and BitDefender Security installed on several phones  I had them de installed while running the tests 
    Battery in the 40  100  range      Below 40  battery  heat and performance effects can occur  Not something you want to blur results with 
    No charging   during benchmark runs   Charging   heat   potential performance impact
    No USB C devices connected   during benchmark runs  although I use it for screenshots in between tests 
  At least 28    free space   on tested medium   Some early tests  as seen in table 05 and 06 and  graph 05 and 06  https   imgur com a RjQBa1a  I had less space free in 2 cards 
    I did not format each card anew   in each device in this test  something I normally would do when committing a microSD card to a specific device for a longer time   If you intend to use a card in an Android phone  I would recommend formatting it in the intended phone  But I did not do that during this test  as this would have taken too long  considering the amount of phone card combinations and the frequent swapping of cards in between tests

Note that AndroBench tends to reset very easily to the internal memory setting  e g  if you connect or disconnect USB C devices  So always check which you are measuring  internal or microSD

If you re wondering  DT Ignite is an app made by Digital Turbine that is installed on phones by carriers  It installs apps on your phone silently without consent  shows ads on your phone s notification center  uses data which could rack up data fees on limited data plans  and collects your data  It s basically a modern version of Carrier IQ 

AT amp T calls it AT amp T App Select  Verizon calls it Verizon App Manager  Tracfone calls it Mobile Services  and the generic name Digital Turbine gave it is Mobile Services Manager 

I went into App Info and they all said  App downloaded from Galaxy Apps  

  You can t disable Galaxy Apps in the Settings app  but some carrier versions of DT Ignite can be disabled  I would highly recommend disabling it   ",Android,beware dt ignite mobile service manager seems built samsung galaxy apps booted galaxy j galaxy apps updated apps silently installed wish news break pandora gsn casino several others onto ad sponsored app also appeared wondering dt ignite app made digital turbine installed phone carrier installs apps silently without consent show ad notification center us data could rack data fee limited data plan collect data basically modern version carrier iq call app select verizon call verizon app manager tracfone call mobile service generic name digital turbine gave mobile service manager went app info said app downloaded galaxy apps disable galaxy apps setting app carrier version dt ignite disabled would highly recommend disabling

39," DISCUSSION  In 2020  is it still a viable strategy to buy a phone with the intention to unlock root custom ROM when official software support ends  Especially if you want to keep using banking apps  Netflix  etc   This is something I realised while I was trying to choose a replacement phone for my aging OnePlus 3T 

Ever since the first Android phones  it used to be relatively easy to extend your device s useful life after its official software support ended   you could just unlock it  slap a custom ROM on it  and use it for another couple of years  

You could even buy phones on hardware merits alone  and disregard software entirely  No more software updates  Bloatware  Buggy or unstable OS  Not liking the OEM skin  As long as unlocking the bootloader was a possibility  you could always switch to a custom ROM and solve any of these issues 

Also  depending on the ROM  there would be virtually no drawbacks   for example  my OP3T is snappy as ever on the official LineageOS 17 1 ROM  and thanks to Magisk Hide  there are no issues with SafetyNet breaking my banking apps 

However    this may no longer be the case going forward   

With  SafetyNet hardware attestation around the corner  https   www xda developers com safetynet hardware attestation hide root magisk    the days of hiding root  may be numbered any day  https   twitter com topjohnwu status 1277916173930164225 ref_src twsrc 5Etfw 7Ctwcamp 5Etweetembed 7Ctwterm 5E1277916173930164225 7Ctwgr 5E amp ref_url https 3A 2F 2Fwww xda developers com 2Fsafetynet hardware attestation hide root magisk 2F     basically  all Google needs to do is flick the switch  and it will no longer be possible to unlock your bootloader without tripping SafetyNet  This locks you out of banking and authentication apps   downgrades streaming quality  https   www androidpolice com 2019 05 28 netflix hd oneplus 7 pro widevine bootloader    and possibly more in the future  since  any app can make use of the SafetyNet API  https   twitter com topjohnwu status 1277683005843111936     I m looking at you  McDonalds  

Now  there s no telling when  or even if  this new SafetyNet implementation is coming  But when it does  it means choosing between using a custom ROM with broken apps  or going back to stock 

But also  specifically for everyone who is in the market for a phone right now  it means taking a gamble  will it still be possible to unlock root customise a few years down the line  without tripping SafetyNet and possibly breaking essential apps 

In other words  if you re buying a phone today  and you want software support for as long as possible    is it still a viable option to buy a phone with the intention to unlock root custom ROM a few years down the line    Or should you just go for a phone with longer official support  i e  Pixel or iPhone  

What would you guys do  if you were buying a phone today  Would the ability to unlock and customise it in a few years still be a consideration when choosing a new device ",Android,discussion still viable strategy buy intention unlock root custom rom official software support end especially want keep using banking apps netflix etc something realised trying choose replacement aging oneplus ever since first phone used relatively easy extend device useful life official software support ended could unlock slap custom rom use another couple year could even buy phone hardware merit alone disregard software entirely software update bloatware buggy unstable o liking oem skin long unlocking bootloader possibility could always switch custom rom solve issue also depending rom would virtually drawback example op snappy ever official lineageos rom thanks magisk hide issue safetynet breaking banking apps however may longer case going forward safetynet hardware attestation around corner http xda developer safetynet hardware attestation hide root magisk day hiding root may numbered day http twitter topjohnwu status ref src twsrc etfw ctwcamp etweetembed ctwterm e ctwgr e ref url http f fwww xda developer fsafetynet hardware attestation hide root magisk f basically google need flick switch longer possible unlock bootloader without tripping safetynet lock banking authentication apps downgrade streaming quality http androidpolice netflix hd oneplus pro widevine bootloader possibly future since app make use safetynet api http twitter topjohnwu status looking mcdonalds telling even new safetynet implementation coming mean choosing using custom rom broken apps going back stock also specifically everyone market right mean taking gamble still possible unlock root customise year line without tripping safetynet possibly breaking essential apps word buying today want software support long possible still viable option buy intention unlock root custom rom year line go longer official support e pixel would guy buying today would ability unlock customise year still consideration choosing new device

41, Exclusive  Samsung officially confirms S21 Ultra and Z Fold 3 will have SPen  The Note series will be discontinued   ,Android,exclusive samsung officially confirms ultra z fold spen note series discontinued
42,"Discovered that the Galaxy S20 s open space inside that creates a resonance chamber on the back panel I have not seen this mentioned on anything official and I don t think it s actually something intentional  more a by product of the way the internals are configured  but I recently got an S20 5G which was an upgrade from an S10e  S8  before that  and noticed that every time I crank the volume up when watching something with action in it that simply by resting my fingers on the back of the phone the whole back panel resonates with the explosions and other action going on as well as resonates with deeper bass notes in music 

I know other phones have had bass chambers before but they were engineered this way 

Quite surprised by this and impressed at its effectiveness to give a sort of force feedback when watching content which is especially effective when coupled by turning on Dolby Atmos which on its own impressed me on the S10e with how wide and positioned sound can be from 2 simple phone speakers 

This is not a phone I planned on buying but a fault with my S10e pushed me this direction and I walk away rather impressed    If you don t rest your fingers on the back panel then there is no such feedback as the thick aluminium frame absorbs it all   

Are there any other accidental cool stuff not only on this phone but others that people have found like this ",Android,discovered galaxy open space inside creates resonance chamber back panel seen mentioned anything official think actually something intentional product way internals configured recently got g upgrade e noticed every time crank volume watching something action simply resting finger back whole back panel resonates explosion action going well resonates deeper bass note music know phone bass chamber engineered way quite surprised impressed effectiveness give sort force feedback watching content especially effective coupled turning dolby atmos impressed e wide positioned sound simple speaker planned buying fault e pushed direction walk away rather impressed rest finger back panel feedback thick aluminium frame absorbs accidental cool stuff others people found like
43,"Some small advanced tips for Chrome I figured to post some small adjustments for Chrome  If you type chrome   flags in the URL bar then you get a separate settings tab where you can enable disable certain settings for little bit battery usage improvement and for people who don t like the tab grouping implementation 

1  Throttling Javascript timers 

When deactivating the tab window in Chrome  various JavaScript task processes are executed in the background  resulting in unnecessary power consumption  By reducing the task processing in the background  the function is to reduce the power consumption and extend the battery life

2  Tab groups

66,"Paying for gas using the new Google Pay app is actually awesome I hate swiping my credit card at gas stations due to the constant issue with potential card skimmers  I ve been trying to limit the stations I use to the ones that have tap to pay using Google Pay  but those are few and far between in my area 

So yesterday I decided to try out the new gas paying method in the redone Google Pay app  It actually is a great experience and worked really well  It seems to work with ExxonMobile and Shell stations in my area  but I m sure there are other brands  

The process is easy   you pull up to the pump  load the app and select your station and then the pump you re at  then pick the card you want to use from Google Pay  You ll see the pump activate and then voila  you are good to go 

I hope this takes off with more brands because it really is easy to use and something everyone should be doing to prevent credit card theft ",Android,paying gas using new google pay app actually awesome hate swiping credit card gas station due constant issue potential card skimmer trying limit station use one tap pay using google pay far area yesterday decided try new gas paying method redone google pay app actually great experience worked really well seems work exxonmobile shell station area sure brand process easy pull pump load app select station pump pick card want use google pay see pump activate voila good go hope take brand really easy use something everyone prevent credit card theft

68,"A Critical Look at Android Email Apps  amp  Clients  Poll  Discussion  Reviews  Hello friends  I have had a dilemma for a year or so now regarding email clients on Android  They all seem to have issues and sacrifices  So I decided to test out the mainstream ones that I would trust with my email stuff 

Let me start off by acknowledging a couple things 

  I know  I know  Why not just use the Gmail app   The Gmail app has a couple of key sacrifices I will cover later in my review of it 
   My email client   X   works perfectly   That s awesome  I want to hear from you  take the poll and tell me what you use and please share in the comments too  If your email client isn t on this list  I will add it  But you gotta fill in the poll for me to be able to do so 
  I am not meaning to put down any developers  users  or anything with this  This is a critical and objective look at common email clients I have used and they have sacrifices  for me   It might be perfect for you and I want to hear about your positive  and negative  experiences with different clients 
  I AM NOT BEING PAID BY ANY DEVELOPER OR ANYTHING
  I am not able to test the Samsung Email App or the LG Email Client at this moment because I lost my old s8 I was planning to test it on and I don t own an LG Phone  I will hopefully find the S8 in the coming days and update with my usage 
  If you have pro s and con s of listed email clients here that I did not touch on  fill out the form at the  end of this post  I will be adding to this post  it is not meant to be stagnant  
  I will be making the results available for anyone to view at the bottom as well

  Fair Email
  Aqua Mail
  Spike Email
  Spark Email

  Gmail  

I have no screenshots  everyone has this app basically  Find it on the play store or already on your phone 

Pros 

  Very Smooth integration
  Comes with all android devices
  Easy to set up

Cons

  Notification actions are not customizable
  Has been having notification issues for many users
  Cannot add a Google Gsuite account without adding it to your android device as a whole without some jank tweaking
    One major con of gmail  and I haven t seen this behaviour anywhere else  is that when you Reply All  it does not show all recipients in the mail chain body  It only shows it was replied to you  Please understand that I m talking about the mail body  The to cc fields show everyone  It s bad for traceability        imakesawdust  https   www reddit com user imakesawdust  

Notes 

Gmail app works rather well  However  it is not exactly productivity focused or  ground breaking  like some other apps  Inbox  Spark  Outlook s Focused Inbox Default  A couple glaring issues I have with it were covered in cons but it does not let you change notification actions  I do not archive emails  I mark them as read or I delete them  Along with this  I cannot add an email account that has any Google integration without it adding that google or gsuite account to my device  For example  I cannot just add my school and work email without them being added to my Android device and thus removing access to some features on the device like assistant 2 0 

 amp  x200B 

  Blackberry Inbox  used to be Hub   

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a nbHvM8L    Link to BlackBerry Manager  https   cobalt232 github io blackberrymanager  

Pros 

  Very productivity focused
  Includes a helpful calendar upcoming events section in the inbox
  Has great customization options for creating custom  views  allowing you to curate different local inboxes to combine inboxes and folders from different email addresses 
  Can integrate notifications from other apps such as Social Media and Group Messaging apps

Cons 

    If you have numinous folders in your email account  syncing is weird and difficult   
  Search function is broken at  times
  Sent folder syncing breaks occasionally
  requires you to have Hub  services from Blackberry which is paid after a certain usage time period
  Otherwise requires Blackberry Manager to download both Hub  services and Inbox
  Doesn t look the best but is ugly by any means
  Notifications have been weird recently  double notifications  grouping and not being able to ungroup 

Notes 

This is a great all around Hub for your notifications from both email and social media group messaging apps  It has weird screen formatting issues and for those with cutouts and notches  it can look weird    It has serious issues with folder syncing becuase I have 10 20 custom folders in my personal gmail and I have to manually tell it to sync every single folder and it is not a single click but rather a couple click process    During testing  I have found that you can indeed sync all folders with just a click or two 

 amp  x200B 

  Sony Email  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a 9fcH9bJ    Link to ApkMirror  https   www apkmirror com apk sony mobile communications sony email 2  

Pros 

  Very clean layout
  useful upcoming events footer
  Simple enough to set up
  syncs all folders without any issues 
  Supports oAuth for gmail accounts for simple sign in

Cons 

  Will be shut down within a year most likely
  Having issues signing into some smtp settings  I got it working but it is a pita

Notes 

  My internship gsuite email will not sync smtp  same with a test gsuite account I created however  other gsuite emails seam to work  I have gone through and tried the 2fa  app password  enabling less secure apps  changed admin policies on the admin side  I cannot get smtp to work on these accounts with this client   

I got this to work finally  I had to make it think it was a gmail based account first then finally sign in by changing information 

  Outlook  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a dfr2ZjL     Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com microsoft office outlook amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Very secure
  Has the backbone of Microsoft
  Makes managing multiple emails pretty easy
  Has a Focus inbox  pro for some  con for me 

Cons 

  Requires you to sign into a google account and add the account to your android devices 
  The focus inbox is crap imo
  It auto defaults to calendar notifications that I find annoying 

Notes 

Outlook gets the job done  The UI is meh  I dont like some of their choices for features 

 amp  x200B 

  Samsung Email  

No screenshots as of right now    Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com samsung android email provider amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Easy set up
  Looks decent
  syncs all folders

Cons

  Samsung device specific
  Does not offer a lot of customization options

Notes  I am not a fan of the design of this app but it  is not bad by any means  It is Samsung device exclusive  I do not like the auto default to calendar syncing 

 amp  x200B 

  LG Email

  AOSP LineageOS Email Client  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a jWEjPVy     ApkMirror Link  https   www apkmirror com apk lineageos email 3 email 3 10 release  

Pros

  Super Simple
  Clean looking
  Works with any account I have tried
  Will always be free

Cons 

  Not simple to find
  Support will most likely be phased out
  Very little customization

Notes 

This client is the simplest out of all of them  Not many customization options  straight forward setup  Unless you use a tweaked version  it doesn t natively support theme changing with device theme change 

 amp  x200B 

  Nine  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a OFrQaVU    Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com ninefolders hd3 amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Support offered
  Syncing works very well
  Offers calendar cynic and views
  Tasks syncing and management

Cons 

  Paid  Just a one time payment  I was wrong about that originally 
  Doesn t offer much customization even though you re paying for it
  Starting to look out of date

Notes 

I personally don t think we should have to pay for such a simple app  If the service was decoupled from usage of the app  I would be okay with it  But a lot of features are locked behind a paywall  The material design is starting feel out of date considering you are paying for this 

 amp  x200B 

  K 9 Email  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a PhsIHw3    Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com fsck k9 amp hl en_US amp gl US     F Droid link with Updated version  https   f droid org en packages com fsck k9  

Pros 

  Open Source
  Free
  Great control over settings

Cons 

    Out of date  on android 10 I get the app targeting earlier API Version warning every time I open it    There is a beta version that is in development that has material design 
  Setting can be confusing not the easiest set up

Notes 

I love the fact this is open source  But the primary app is very out of date  I really do not like the look of it and it plays weirdly with notches and hole punches     Updated Notes     A couple people pointed out that there is a beta version out that has a material design  I haven t tried it but will and will report back with screengrabs 

 amp  x200B 

  Fair Email  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a SLlRylM    Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id eu faircode email amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Open Source
  Very granular control over sync and email
  Being updated often
  Fair amount of customization

Cons 

  Does not look the best
  doesn t play well with stricture GSuite accounts 

 amp  x200B 

  Aqua  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a P3LNW4e     Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id org kman AquaMail amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Clean UI
  Easy Setup

Cons 

    Shoves paid version down your throat  
  Apparently the version on the Play Store is purposefully a two week trial 
  Pins paid banner to compose and sends them out as signatures  which I find really annoying if you want me to try a two week period  let me us the full features for a week or two then pin the banned back 

Notes 

The constant annoying for the paid version which is already at a high price is a complete deal breaker for me  even though this is a two week trial  The fact that it pins it to your signature is absurd when you are supposed to let me try it for two weeks and see if I like it 

 amp  x200B 

  Spike  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a 1ohDCC7     Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com pingapp app amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Pros 

  Offers all in one solution for calendar  contacts
  Decent UI
  Has a ton of features

Cons 

  The UI is IOS looking based
  It can get overwhelming
  Is bloated
  Has a paid version that they hide good features behind

Notes 

I am impartial to this UI  but I wish it would have its own design following material instead of a Facebook and IOS mix  It doesn t look that good for me and is too busy  It does have a lot of features though 

 amp  x200B 

  Spark  

 Screenshots  https   imgur com a vSBHXS8    Play Store Link  https   play google com store apps details id com readdle spark amp hl en_US 

Pros 

  Very clean UI
  Easy to us
  Offers just enough without being overwhelming

Cons 

  Does not have a ton of features

Notes 

I really like Spark  I have hesitation of its security though  It looks really good and is pretty simple

70,"Was thinking about buying an old 3D capable phone but apparently some companies are still making them  So I was randomly thinking about 3D photography and how it never took off when phones like the HTC EVO 3D were around  Then I thought to myself  hey those phones are probably cheap enough to justify buying it for the 3D camera alone  and in my search I discovered that there were  still  companies making 3D smartphones up until at least last year 

https   en wikipedia org wiki List_of_3D enabled_mobile_phones

For instance  this  Rokit 3D phone  https   rokitphones com us phones iopro3d   is  140  Now it s probably no different than buying some random brand phone off aliexpress but if it was literally just a digital camera that took 3D shots  then  140 doesn t seem like too bad of a price  Just browsing Amazon for a 3D capable camera shows I d have to pay  400  for that feature 

Now  comparing that to an HTC EVO 3D off ebay for  35  40 used    well yeah I could save myself  100 but I d be on Android 4 x with a Snapdragon S3 and 1GB of RAM  The Rokit has a Mediatek P23  might be similar in performance to a SD 600 series   and 4GB of RAM with Android 9  And probably the most noticeable difference would be the screen resolution  The HTC s 4 3  960 540 screen is horrid  haha

EDIT  so I saw the Rokit on Amazon and the reviews say it s not  true  3D capture    it s not a SBS pic but they actual take one shot and then you have to physically move the phone to take the other image    which I do already on my regular smartphone  just without a bit of software help  So it looks like for the USA  the best option is a used RED Hydrogen One that s priced similar to dedicated 3D cams but you get the added bonus of a 3D display and the ability to use apps for uploading your files  I suppose I would prefer having a large screen to view my content and the ability to sync to Dropbox instead of having a tiny camera that requires a microSD card to transfer my content ",Android,thinking buying old capable apparently company still making randomly thinking photography never took phone like htc evo around thought hey phone probably cheap enough justify buying camera alone search discovered still company making smartphones least last year http en wikipedia org wiki list enabled mobile phone instance rokit http rokitphones u phone iopro probably different buying random brand aliexpress literally digital camera took shot seem like bad price browsing amazon capable camera show pay feature comparing htc evo ebay used well yeah could save x snapdragon gb ram rokit mediatek p might similar performance sd series gb ram probably noticeable difference would screen resolution htc screen horrid haha edit saw rokit amazon review say true capture sb pic actual take one shot physically move take image already regular smartphone without bit software help look like usa best option used red hydrogen one priced similar dedicated cam get added bonus display ability use apps uploading file suppose would prefer large screen view content ability sync dropbox instead tiny camera requires microsd card transfer content

77,"Do you micromanage your phone s battery  There are various conflicting opinions on what are the best practices for maintaining your battery s health over time  This became a concern when smartphones quickly moved away from removable batteries 

There are people who advise draconian measures  such as keeping the battery charge level between 40    80   as well as only using a slow 5W charger 

On the other side  there are those who don t want to pay attention to any of that  letting their phone go close to empty  then charging it to full on a fast 25W   charger and leaving it plugged in overnight  They tend to argue that the stress  time and effort spent micromanaging your battery is just not worth it  and that if considerable degradation does occur after a year or so  that one should simply just get a replacement which should only be in the double digit price range 

Then  there s everything in between 

So where do you stand on this with your phone  Do you micromanage it to try to extend the battery s lifespan as much as possible  or do you just use your phone without worrying one least bit about any of that 


For me  I use only Apple 5W slow charging bricks and slow car chargers to limit heat generation as much as possible  and try to keep the charge level between 20    90  when possible 

I feel like 30    70  or 40    80  is far too inconvenient and beats the purpose of enjoying your phone  and would just result in voluntarily reducing your battery s capacity far more than 1 2 years of normal degradation would ",Android,micromanage battery various conflicting opinion best practice maintaining battery health time became concern smartphones quickly moved away removable battery people advise draconian measure keeping battery charge level well using slow w charger side want pay attention letting go close empty charging full fast w charger leaving plugged overnight tend argue stress time effort spent micromanaging battery worth considerable degradation occur year one simply get replacement double digit price range everything stand micromanage try extend battery lifespan much possible use without worrying one least bit use apple w slow charging brick slow car charger limit heat generation much possible try keep charge level possible feel like far inconvenient beat purpose enjoying would result voluntarily reducing battery capacity far year normal degradation would
78,"Unpopular opinion  High refresh rate screens are pointless for phones I ve had a razer phone 2 for just over 2 yrs now  I love the screen  1440p 16x9 great for watching videos You can choose the screen to run at 60  90  or 120hz  I use it as a normal phone i rarely game on it  have pc for that   When it came out  there was literally a handful of mobile games that support high refresh rate  and now nearly every major phone supports 90 120hz  and there s only a few at a full 1440 res IIRC  so razer was way ahead of the game in that aspect   It s buttery smooth and looks great at 1440 120  but here s the drawback 

It absolutely destroys battery life  I noticed that even when I first got it  You can set the screen to run at 1080p if you like  but the screen looks fuzzy  Too fuzzy for me

80,"Lenovo User Experience killed my tablet  an analysis of Lenovo s shady doings Main story 

 Hey there  I m Bare  and today I wanted to talk about Lenovo again   
This was going to be how my second video about Lenovo was going to start  But something went really wrong  

You might remember this link from back in the day  
https   www reddit com r Android comments b78wuj the_bundled_nonremovable_virus_that_is_called   
It is about a program called Lenovo User Experience that has some really weird abilities  especially for an event logger  such as asking for root  
That s not all though it turns out  but more on that later  
This link was how I found out about the suspicious nature of the service while debloating my Yoga Tab 3 X50F  I immediately removed it with adb  
However  this wasn t my last fight with it at all  and recently it appeared in Magisk  while not being there before and being disabled and not installed but   still running 
So i decided to look around the files with X Plore  or sth like that   And I found 2 files with some really interesting permissions for UE  One of them being  download packages  Of course I set all of them to  false   But that came with a catch  after a reboot    it bootlooped  
https   mobile twitter com BareGamer status 1328772990914400258

Consequences 

Essentially that led me down a rabbit hole to a poor decision of wiping the tablet entirely  leaving only TWRP  Now I needed an OS again  Of course  I found one   a Chinese ROM  And let me tell you  this is just a security nightmare  Everything there can read your phone calls  and some unrelated app even reroute them  send receive smses  read contact lists   Also  of course UE wasn t in the license  

Another layer 

If you have enough attention to click on the 2nd link in google  you will find a site that disassembled the ue service version of the UE mine was newue service   The article recommended blocking lenovomm com in a hosts file  But what s the site  Just a   generic chinese app store  That s not all though  So what can it be about 

When I was trying to boot the tab  I was talking with a dude  He also had a lenovo tab  and we both started wondering if he had ue too  He did  Force stopped it  And it showed an add with clear suggestive undertones  Strange huh  Not at all  This seems to be consistent with my other lenovo add experience  They have a service built in that pushes adds  including erotic suggestive ones  Maybe   it has the adds from the store s address 

It all ties up 

When I installed the Chinese rom  I saw   Lenovo s app store  sketchy permissions just as always  The app was even upfront about it  Yes  it all fit together well  

Addition 
My classmate told me a story about how his friend deleted lenovo s sustemui and got about 30 porn apps in exchange whatever that means   Not verifiable though  as not experienced by me first hand  

Conclusion 
Lenovo never stopped being shady after their pc scandals  In fact it only got worse  Considering the fact that they built their app store with china telecom  they might just be targetting Chinese dissidents this way  
   and they also know how they look

89,"New Android user thoughts After spending a lot of time on this forum  I finally decided to switch to Android from iOS after having iPhones for almost a decade now  I found it helpful to read others  thoughts experiences on the switch so here are mine  I switched from a cracked iPhone XR to the Note 20 Ultra  the discounts on damaged phone tradeins were just too tempting   I have never used an Android phone before  

What I really like about android so far  1 week in  
1  The always on display  I didn t even know this was a thing but it s awesome  I was a bit worried about battery life at first but it hasn t been an issue at all  Being able to see notifications are waiting and the time while my phone is just sitting on the desk is great  
2  I can use whatever services I like best for cloud storage  gaming  photos etc  and they just work  
3  This is Samsung specific  but Dex is way better than I expected  
4  Also Samsung specific  the S pen is outstanding and Samsung notes in particular works better than any note taking app I ve used before  
5  Notifications on Android are great and I really appreciate how easy it is to clear notifications for multiple apps all at once  No more clicking around in apps to try and find out why it has a notification bubble 
6  The settings app on Android is much easier to use and has a layout that made sense to me  The settings app on iOS is definitely lackluster in comparison  



What I miss from iOS 
1  iMessage and FaceTime  Nearly all my friends and family use iOS so losing access to those is a bit rough  That said  I switched to Signal on Android and it s pretty good for messaging  however  the video call is generally poor quality and I ve had so so luck with the Signal audio calls   Google Duo has great quality for video chats though so that s my new video chatting platform of choice  Some of my contacts gave me a hard time for becoming a  green bubble  but all the people I normally chat with were happy to download duo and most even downloaded signal as well  It s becoming less of an issue than it was on days 1 and 2  but Apple s messaging apps are definitely a bit better than anything I ve found on Android so far  
2  Voicemail isn t in the phone app  I d forgotten I used to call my carrier to get my voicemail as iPhones just put voicemail into the phone app  I downloaded the voicemail app from my carrier so it s not a huge deal  but feels a bit odd that voicemail isn t in the default phone app   
3  FaceID  Having an underscreen fingerprint reader is great  especially when wearing a mask  but FaceID was so convenient  It let you glance at your locked iPhone  which would then unlock to show sensitive details on the lock screen  

All of my apps from iOS are on Android so I haven t noticed any issues in terms of platform support  I do enjoy casual gaming and the ability to cloud game on Android is great  The cloud gaming experience I ve encountered so far isn t as good as playing on a console or computer in the same room  minor stutters here and there   but the option to do so is welcome  

Overall I m very pleased with the switch  I might switch back in a year or two but I m very happy I m giving android a shot  If you re thinking about switching from iOS to Android  or vice versa   I d say go for it  Despite the fear I had that it would be terribly difficult to change and it would ruin my digital life  it s been remarkably simple and a fun experience 

If you recently switched to Android or have been using it for ages  I m curious  what do you like best ",Android,new user thought spending lot time forum finally decided switch io almost decade found helpful read others thought experience switch mine switched cracked xr note ultra discount damaged tradeins tempting never used really like far week always display even know thing awesome bit worried battery life first issue able see notification waiting time sitting desk great use whatever service like best cloud storage gaming photo etc work samsung specific dex way better expected also samsung specific pen outstanding samsung note particular work better note taking app used notification great really appreciate easy clear notification multiple apps clicking around apps try find notification bubble setting app much easier use layout made sense setting app io definitely lackluster comparison miss io imessage facetime nearly friend family use io losing access bit rough said switched signal pretty good messaging however video call generally poor quality luck signal audio call google duo great quality video chat though new video chatting platform choice contact gave hard time becoming green bubble people normally chat happy download duo even downloaded signal well becoming le issue day apple messaging apps definitely bit better anything found far voicemail app forgotten used call carrier get voicemail put voicemail app downloaded voicemail app carrier huge deal feel bit odd voicemail default app faceid underscreen fingerprint reader great especially wearing mask faceid convenient let glance locked would unlock show sensitive detail lock screen apps io noticed issue term platform support enjoy casual gaming ability cloud game great cloud gaming experience encountered far good playing console computer room minor stutter option welcome overall pleased switch might switch back year two happy giving shot thinking switching io vice versa say go despite fear would terribly difficult change would ruin digital life remarkably simple fun experience recently switched using age curious like best

99,"Let s talk about the Android Share Menu Interface So as most of you know  Google has been struggling with the sharing interface for many versions now  One of their major focuses in Android Q 10 was improving the speed at which this interface triggered  primarily due to poor caching behaviours   and further tweaked for Android 11 

However  while the new menu interface loads much more quickly  the inconsistencies of what options lie therein seem even more confusing

I don t really understand the reasoning or design behind this interface   The fact that it suggests random people on random platforms  I ve had it recommend sending an Instagram contact a private message when I last used it over a month prior    is there a better way to set this up to work efficiently  or some wayo to control what and who are suggested ",Android,let talk share menu interface know google struggling sharing interface many version one major focus q improving speed interface triggered primarily due poor caching behaviour tweaked however new menu interface load much quickly inconsistency option lie therein seem even confusing sharing url product chrome suggest contact message default text app telegram whatsapp never current even recent conversation someone switch chrome look something related chat hit share conversation one first couple suggestion never seems case force user scroll list apps find one want alphabetically choose contact really understand reasoning design behind interface fact suggests random people random platform recommend sending instagram contact private message last used month prior better way set work efficiently wayo control suggested

147," Discussion  What are the best alternatives for Google Photos  Hi in recent news about Google Photos ditching the unlimited storage  do you have any good recommendation for storing your photos online  Free or paid is fine  as long as they re not too expensive 

I tried to look for alternatives  and so far have found flickr pro  72USD year  quite expensive  and smugmug  55USD year for basic plan  that offers unlimited storage for a fee  

For a more general storage I also found pCloud that offers lifetime 2TB storage for a one time fee  245USD for single user and 500USD to split between 4 people  

Has anyone used them and can give some kind of comparison with Google Photos  Any other alternatives that I don t know about 

Thank you 

Edit  a little bit more context  I ve already paid for Google One  200GB  for the past 3 4 years  and according to photos google com storage I only have another 2 years to fill my 200GB storage  So I was looking for alternatives that really offers unlimited storage  I might or might not end up using it  Just want to know what my options are 

Previously with Google  I had this plan B where I can convert my photos and videos to High Quality and reclaim storage ",Android,discussion best alternative google photo hi recent news google photo ditching unlimited storage good recommendation storing photo online free paid fine long expensive tried look alternative far found flickr pro usd year quite expensive smugmug usd year basic plan offer unlimited storage fee general storage also found pcloud offer lifetime tb storage one time fee usd single user usd split people anyone used give kind comparison google photo alternative know thank edit little bit context already paid google one gb past year according photo google storage another year fill gb storage looking alternative really offer unlimited storage might might end using want know option previously google plan b convert photo video high quality reclaim storage

149,"My short experience with the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro My LG V20 finally pissed me off so much that I couldn t live with it any more  so I got myself a phone that has caused some discussion here recently   the Mi 10T Pro 

I ve had it for 4 days now  so these are my first impressions so far 

  The screen is really good  There s been quite a lot of discussion about it and some people accused XDA of being impartial  but the truth is that it s a bloody good LCD  144hz is really something  coming from 60hz  though probably I would be happy also with 120hz  The screen itself is bright  the colors are strong and vibrant and the viewing angles are also superb  AMOLED would have had some advantages  always on display  better blacks   but in reality the screen is really good and I can t say that I m missing out on something 
  The variable refresh rate is also working spot on  I was a bit worried about this  but in reality you can t really notice the refresh rate changing  Thumbs up for that 
  The battery life is great  I ve only had it for a couple of days  so I m still tinkering with it more than I normally would  but I m getting 8h SOT  which is not bad  The 33w charger fills the 5000mAh battery up in roughly an hour 
  The main reason I preferred this to the S20 FE is the CPU  as in Europe the S20 is sold with the Exynos CPU  The SD865 in the 10T Pro is  like you would expect  a good combination with the 144hz screen and I haven t seen any slowdowns yet  
  I haven t had the opportunity to test the cameras a lot yet  but so far they seem pretty good  especially considering the price  The 108mp main camera makes great pictures and combined with OIS and EIS  it s very usable also in dark settings  The ultra wide angle makes good photos in daylight  but when it gets dark  it doesn t hold up as well as the main camera  I would say it s on level with my old V20 wide angle  There s also a 5MP macro lens  but I haven t tested it enough yet 
  Build quality is great  it feels very solid in hand  It s a large phone  keep that in mind  and with the 5000mAh battery  it s also quite heavy  but at least the weight is balances so that it doesn t feel like it s falling out of your hand all the time  
  MIUI   was expecting a lot of ads  a lot of bloatware  but so far I haven t seen a single ad and there was hardly any bloatware  Maybe it s due to the fact that they don t add all that crap to phones sold in Europe  In fact  it came with Google Dialer and Google Contacts pre installed  so they have swapped most of their own apps with Google ones 

So far I m really happy with it  Even though I was worried that I would miss some of the features of the V20  other things such as a great screen  great battery life and solid performance make up for it ",Android,short experience xiaomi mi pro lg v finally pissed much live got caused discussion recently mi pro day first impression far screen really good quite lot discussion people accused xda impartial truth bloody good lcd hz really something coming hz though probably would happy also hz screen bright color strong vibrant viewing angle also superb amoled would advantage always display better black reality screen really good say missing something variable refresh rate also working spot bit worried reality really notice refresh rate changing thumb battery life great couple day still tinkering normally would getting h sot bad w charger fill mah battery roughly hour main reason preferred fe cpu europe sold exynos cpu sd pro like would expect good combination hz screen seen slowdown yet opportunity test camera lot yet far seem pretty good especially considering price mp main camera make great picture combined ois eis usable also dark setting ultra wide angle make good photo daylight get dark hold well main camera would say level old v wide angle also mp macro lens tested enough yet build quality great feel solid hand large keep mind mah battery also quite heavy least weight balance feel like falling hand time miui expecting lot ad lot bloatware far seen single ad hardly bloatware maybe due fact add crap phone sold europe fact came google dialer google contact pre installed swapped apps google one far really happy even though worried would miss feature v thing great screen great battery life solid performance make

154,"My Pixel 4a review coming from a OP7pro   TL DR    won t miss much  Not even 90 Hz  wide angle or tele photo lenses  Great battery  build  screen  haptics  size  camera and speakers 

So after 1 5 years enjoying a OnePlus 7 Pro  I switched to a Google Pixel 4a primarily because of the smaller size  1 5 years is the longest I ve ever had a phone  Was really enjoying the OnePlus experience 

Here is my review after a week of usage of the Google Pixel 4a 

My use case is phone  teams  messenger  sms  camera  YouTube and browsing 

  Size    obviously the difference in size is a primary objective  The 4a for surfing and reading news in one hand usage is a joy  Also the weight of the 4a makes it a fantastic daily tool  It s so comfortable small that a thin cover doesn t ruin the overall size  Also it s not so small that two finger writing is cramped like on my wife s 2020 iPhone SE 

  Build quality    at first glance I was surprised  that it s made of plastic  It s so well made  that it feels like an aluminium phone covered in a soft touch material  It s also sturdy  it seems  now that Sack gave it some love  The in hand feel is what I have been paying Dbrand for  when mounting skins on my multitude of glass sandwich phones in the past like S6  S7 Edge  S8  S9  S10e  OP7pro etc 
The power button and volume same is placed exactly where my right thumb easily reaches 
 
  Screen    a very well made AMOLED supporting HDR  I m so happy to get a flat screen again  after so many year s of edge type displays   the punch hole camera cutout is what it is  Fast brightness adaptation for once  Good brightness in sunlight and sufficiently low brightness in darkness  Good support for cheap screen protectors 

The performance of the screen is so good  that after a few hours of usage  I don t notice the downgrade in refresh rate  I m serious  
When tapping on the screen the feedback does not feel like a hollow phone feeling 

  Haptics    great vibration motor that feels somewhat like a linear actuator  rather than the circular motor it actually is  I don t feel a difference from an iPhone to be honest  But it s so strong that even setting the keyboard vibration in Gboard to 1 ms is too much  Turned it off 

  Speakers    this is one important subject to me  And I m happy to report that they are great  Greater than on an iPhone SE with better balance and stereo separation  although the 4a amplification could be better  I ve modified the max loudness via the Wavelet app  so that the lows and highs and a little boost in the mid ranges easily compensates  Comparing to a iPhone Xr speakers the 4a speakers with my mods  sounds even more bassy and with great highs in direct comparison  It s that good 

  Battery    writing this at 9 PM after unplugging 6 30 AM  16 hours  off charger and 4 hours of screen on time  I have 46  battery left  A true all day phone with lots to spare 

  Performance    this is funny  Until now I didn t think of any difference in daily tasks  Only the Google Camera HDR process takes a few seconds to complete  But only noticeable when takin pictures in sequence going to check the results directly  Again my use case doesn t demand much CPU 

  Fingerprint sensor    really fast  precise and doesn t even need to cover the whole sensor  The tip of a finger is enough to unlock the phone  

  Charging    I think the first charge took 1 5 hours with a USB PD 18 watt charger  I charge overnight with an old 1 amp charger  I wish it had wireless charging  as my phone holder in our car supports it  Other than that  I don t really miss it  because of the great battery life without the need of topping up when not using the phone 

  Network    good WiFi strength and good LTE signal  I was surprised and happy to see  that my local network TDC in Denmark supports VoLTE and VoWiFi  even without it being officially on their list of phones  as the Pixel is not officially sold in Denmark  Also eSIM works like a charm  Running with my private number as eSIM and company number as traditional SIM  Bluetooth connectivity without issues 

  Camera    it s a Pixel    As good as Gcam on the OnePlus 7 Pro in comparison 

  Software    it s a Pixel

157,"Xperia 5 II thoughts from a 10  years iPhone user A little background first  My first smartphone was an iPhone 3G  and I ve owned the majority of the iPhones released since then  My main reasons for switching were wanting a fingerprint reader over FaceID  which even before masks I ve always hated  and the lack of a headphone jack  which despite me mostly using wireless headphones I ve really missed being able to connect to my Hi Fi and the latency free audio of wired ones  

I ve been using the 5 II for a little over a month now  I actually received it a week before it s official launch day  Since it s what I think most are interested in I ll start with the main negative  


  Camera  

Yes  despite what reviewers say  in real world usage I ve found the camera to be by far the worst part of the phone  My usage mostly encompasses indoor photos of pets  and as you ll see in the example photos it fails at that  The first problem is that autofocus is terrible  Often times I ll have to tap on the subject multiple times to get it to focus  and even then it sometimes still appears fuzzy  Sometimes it will say the object is too close to focus when it isn t  and then a few seconds later forget that was a problem at all  But the worst part is the amount of time it takes to take photos  On my iPhone XS I would always take two in a second in case one was blurry  with this that is impossible  It takes at least two seconds  and sometimes longer between shots when indoors  This means that a lot of my shots I ve started moving the phone as I thought it was done already  and then the photo is ruined  Or my dog has completely moved positions  resulting in a blurry mess  This is worst on the tele photo lens  but true on all of them  I don t feel like reviewers spent enough time using the camera indoors  or in anything but perfect lighting to see how bad it is in this situation  

I ve included some good and some bad photos  Bare in mind that for the good ones I often had to take multiple photos to get it right  My main problem is how inconsistent and slow it is   Album   https   imgur com a EfVu9JS  

The front camera  as many have noted  is even worse  When a face is in frame the words  Soft snap  appear  and a beautification effect that even when turned off in settings is applied  I ve tested this by quickly moving the frame away and back to my face  and for the split second before it realises it s a face there is much more detail  I hope in a future update this is fixed  

Aside from that it annoys me that when the battery is low the camera app will not open  simply saying I need to charge  I d rather at least get the chance to take a photo before it dies  I haven t used it much for video but it seems very good  The stabilisation is fine and focus is actually faster than when using the camera  colours also look great  I do like having the camera button  but the force needed to press it sometimes blurs images  


  Design  

The phone feels solid  Even though it is aluminium  perhaps 7000 series as I think either the 1 or 1 II was quoted as being it  it feels no less strong than my XS  stainless steel  I don t find the glass too slippery  but I think when people say this about new phones they forget just how much more slippy a fresh oleophobic coating is to one that has worn off  I don t feel the need to use a case and with the phone completely bare there aren t any scratches to the frame or either side of glass  When pocketed the height of the phone is annoying when kneeling to put on shoes  but the narrow frame means it isn t as bad as some other large phones  


  Screen   

I appreciate the higher refresh rate screen  although it doesn t make as much impact as on my iPad Pro  One thing people have complained about is brightness  Unfortunately  the area in Britain I live in has not seen a day of sunshine since I got it  so so far at least I haven t been able to see if it s a problem  One thing that annoys me is that text smoothing seems to be pretty bad  It is a lot easier to see individual pixels in text than on my XS  despite the PPI being almost identical  I enjoy the overall height of the screen  and how narrow it is  I have small hands and could only just reach my thumb to the side of my XS when holding it securely  With this that is easy   


  Everything else  

  Battery life has been great  I get one and a half to two days from it  
  The front firing speakers are a revelation  I love how I can hold the phone properly without blocking the bottom one 
  The notification light is surprisingly useful  I feel like all phones should have one 
  You don t need to press the fingerprint reader to unlock the screen  meaning sometimes when I pocket it my thumb brushes against and unlocks it  Sometimes it unlocks with a finger I haven t registered  which is  concerning  These are annoying but not dealbreakers for me  Apart from that it s perfect and far better than FaceID  
  If you live in the UK this thing is extremely cheap on contract  My 24 month plan has 54GB of 5G data per month  and after selling the preorder bonus headphones actually costs the same overall as if I d bought it outright 
  Forget it if you want to use the flash as a torch  It s the weakest I ve ever had in a phone  
  The Google Assistant button is useless and can t be customised  although hopefully in the future button reassinging apps will be able to change it  


  Conclusion  

Overall I m not sure if I d recommend the phone if you intend to take many photos indoors or in imperfect lighting  Outdoors photos are great  but for those situations I have a mirrorless camera  I don t miss iOS too much and I don t regret buying the phone  The ability to have multiple apps open at once and Facebook chat bubbles is amazing  Apple Music also works just as well as on iOS  

If you have any questions feel free

175,"I tested the Note 20 Ultra Exynos 990 model and the result is worrying You won t believe in my country they only sell the Exynos model and after watching many YouTube videos where they claim it s bad but not THAT bad I decided to just buy it  and at  1300 I thought it couldn t be that bad of a processor  WRONG 

Tried Mobile Legends Bang Bang and after downloading the resourced I noticed the device was stuttering  everything from choosing a character to selecting where to cast the spells  it was so sluggish I couldn t believe this was such an expensive device  even a  350 device could do better  

I went and tried playing Call of Duty Mobile and it wasn t that bad compared to Mobile Legends but it was a bit laggy and the graphics even tho they were at max they seemed low res  It got hot really fast and battery started draining like crazy  

I DO NOT recommend this phone if your intention is playing  I was a player but after having these issues with this phone then I m gonna have to find a way to be more productive and try to purchase a new phone solely for playing because in the meantime this phone sucks for mobile gaming 

At least the Exynos version since I haven t tried the snapdragon  The Exynos version is terrible  it s trash and even an iPhone X could do much  much better than this phone does at playing some games  I cannot believe I have such an expensive device that is unable to play games properly and also why TF aren t YouTubers telling the whole truth  they only mention it s below the SD model but they never mention some games are unplayable because of the bad processor optimization of the Exynos  I hate Samsung and I m not buying any other Samsung phone after what happened  I wish I could get my money back and buy another device but I will have to stick to this until next year    There s nothing I can do ",Android,tested note ultra exynos model result worrying believe country sell exynos model watching many youtube video claim bad bad decided buy thought bad processor wrong tried mobile legend bang bang downloading resourced noticed device stuttering everything choosing character selecting cast spell sluggish believe expensive device even device could better went tried playing call duty mobile bad compared mobile legend bit laggy graphic even tho max seemed low re got hot really fast battery started draining like crazy recommend intention playing player issue gonna find way productive try purchase new solely playing meantime suck mobile gaming least exynos version since tried snapdragon exynos version terrible trash even x could much much better playing game cannot believe expensive device unable play game properly also tf youtubers telling whole truth mention sd model never mention game unplayable bad processor optimization exynos hate samsung buying samsung happened wish could get money back buy another device stick next year nothing

178,"For those looking across the pond at the new iPhone 12 Lineup I got my first android phone in 2011  It was a tiny little thing running froyo like a champ  I am currently using a Oneplus 6 that I bought when it came out in May 2018  I have been really happy with it and will use it until at least May if not longer 

I have been mostly unimpressed with recent android releases  The phones that caught my eye and that are in my price range  once they are eventually discounted  are the pixel 4a and 5 and the samsung galaxy FE  Looking across the tech pond  Apple has produced some great phones that really peaked my interest 

I am also planning to purchase an iPad so the pairing would between the two devices would be nice  On my laptop  I will continue to use windows because I am an engineer and MacOS is just not worth the compromises in program availability 

I ve been thinking a lot about the switch and put together this short cost benefit analysis for switching 

  Reasons to stay with Android   

   Technological reasons  
     Customization of the interface   nova launcher  double tap home screen to sleep wake  programmable shutdown times
   Hardware options  
     fingerprint sensors  foldables   gaming phones
   Sunk Cost   
     A decade of investment in google play store
     Google opinion rewards  If you don t use this  you should   google has given me  300 for answering quick 1 minute surveys over the past 5 years or so 
     Several USB C chargers 
   Google integration  I use gmail and drive frequently    
     Ease of sharing files via email  google drive  dropbox  and onedrive

  Reasons to leave Android   

   Technological reasons  
     5 years of guaranteed updates
     Convenience of Airdrop and iMessage
     Solid reliable camera for photos and videos
     Apps that always work well because of the huge userbase using the same OS
   Cultural Reasons 
     70  of friends and family use iDevices 
     Blue bubble FOMO
     interesting gimmicks like the new magsafe wireless charging  The cases and wallet are stupid  
     Marketing  Apple is great at marketing and I feel myself drawn to the iPhone 12 more than any other phone 

I ve thought about it a lot and I will probably buy the pixel 5 for my next phone  The size really appeals to me and wireless charging is somethings that I would like to use  I will miss the notification slider to quickly silence my phone and the headphone jack  but these are not huge compromises for being first in line for software and security updates  I decided to post this because I figure that someone might like to see my thought process  

My wishes for the future of android 

  That all US based smartphone users would all adopt a common messaging app so that I can share photos and videos with my friends and family without the photo degradation that I experience on SMS  AFAIK  there is no good way to share videos from an android phone that doesn t involve a link 
  Small phones make a comeback  I have average sized hands and want to be able to reach all the corners of my phone  Pixel 5 and 4a are a nice start ",Android,looking across pond new lineup got first tiny little thing running froyo like champ currently using oneplus bought came may really happy use least may longer mostly unimpressed recent release phone caught eye price range eventually discounted pixel samsung galaxy fe looking across tech pond apple produced great phone really peaked interest also planning purchase ipad pairing would two device would nice laptop continue use window engineer macos worth compromise program availability thinking lot switch put together short cost benefit analysis switching reason stay technological reason customization interface nova launcher double tap home screen sleep wake programmable shutdown time hardware option fingerprint sensor foldables gaming phone sunk cost decade investment google play store google opinion reward use google given answering quick minute survey past year several usb c charger google integration use gmail drive frequently ease sharing file via email google drive dropbox onedrive reason leave technological reason year guaranteed update convenience airdrop imessage solid reliable camera photo video apps always work well huge userbase using o cultural reason friend family use idevices blue bubble fomo interesting gimmick like new magsafe wireless charging case wallet stupid marketing apple great marketing feel drawn thought lot probably buy pixel next size really appeal wireless charging somethings would like use miss notification slider quickly silence headphone jack huge compromise first line software security update decided post figure someone might like see thought process wish future u based smartphone user would adopt common messaging app share photo video friend family without photo degradation experience sm afaik good way share video involve link small phone make comeback average sized hand want able reach corner pixel nice start

Would I miss the auxiliary cameras  Maybe twice a year  If the camera quality of gimmicky aux cams was better  it would probably be a different story  I wish manufacturers would be more thoughtful than racing after each other by slamming even more mediocre cams on the back of their phones  

A great minus 
It adds additional proprietary hardware that an after market OS like Lineage can only handle in hacky ways  If you wish for an AOSP based ROM  you might end up with dead aux cams 

EDIT  Thanks guys  I started this topic in order to hear different opinions  I am absolutely aware that people enjoy aux cams  And that there is not a single kind of aux cam setup  It all comes down to quality in the end  I am not hating on aux cams nor on people who enjoy them

208,"I ve had an LG Wing for two weeks now and thought I d share some details on what owning it is like  as well as answer any questions about it  I should start this by saying I ve always gravitated towards two types of phones  those with physical keyboards  and those with pen support  I like phones with alternate input methods  and I like weird phones  When I first saw images of the Wing I thought it was a really strange  almost unnecessarily weird device  but as time went on and more videos came out I grew more and more interested in it  I ve already discovered a number of interesting useful features that I haven t seen touched on in any of the videos  as well as some odd bugs here and there that should be addressed in here too 

First impressions 

  This thing is long  I mean LOOOOOONG BOI  The main screen has a 20 5 9 aspect ratio  and that s on a 6 8  display  As a result  I do notice it in my pocket more than I did with previous phones  especially while driving  I find myself taking it out of my pocket and placing it on the seat on longer drives 

  While it is a big device  it somehow doesn t feel very thick  The main display is razor thin and doesn t add much to the profile of the Wing  so it actually ends up feeling like a normal phone in your hands 

  LG clearly wanted to pull some iPhone users with this thing  From some near exact stock wallpapers  though they re actually animated on the Wing     to EXACT navigation gestures from the iPhone      I have been a bit behind the game and did not realize this is an Android 10 thing  Sorry folks     and extra features like screen recording and whatever else  this thing reeks of iOS  My girlfriend is a die hard Apple fan and she actually said this is the first Android device she d ever consider buying 

Thoughts after a couple weeks 

  Typing on the second screen feels   surprisingly natural  I ve always despised typing on a touchscreen and use swipe sliding whenever I can  but    man this feels nice  It actually almost satisfies my physical keyboard craving  This one was also immediately confirmed with my girlfriend  as it was her first question when she saw me use it  LG really got the weight balance and feel of this thing right  and typing from the lower screen is just so easy to pick up and start using  which is a very good thing because of my next point     

  The LG keyboard SUUUUUUUCKS  No  like you need to listen to me  The default LG keyboard is an absolute pile of manure  Autofill CONSTANTLY fights with you and tries to replace basic words with fun new words LG thought you might wanna sprinkle in there  Sometimes  when sliding  it ll be so eager to to replace your word with a new one that it can t even decide which weird to replace it with and ends up entering two words without even spacing them out  and neither will be the word you even wanted in the first place  You can disable autofill  of course  but doing so will also disable auto capitalizing certain things like  I  and proper nouns     LG  please make that a separate option    You can also swap your keyboard with another one  but as far as I can tell at this point   the only keyboard that is supported on the second screen in swivel mode is the default LG keyboard    This makes things difficult  as I HATE using the LG keyboard on the main screen for slide typing  but I love single key typing on the lower screen  LG  please   PLEASE   fix your God awful keyboard  or at least let us use third parties on the lower screen 

  Speaking of input methods    The Wing DOES support active pen input    I can confirm that my Wing does respond to my Bamboo Ink Gen 2 pen  and actually has a pop up menu for drawing notes  I don t know why this isn t advertised as a feature  because to me this is like having a Galaxy Note with a slide out keyboard  Two things of note  no pun intended   pen input ONLY works on the main display  not on the lower one  I also have a Surface pen and an old HTC Flyer pen  both of which use N Trig  and they DO NOT work with it  Best to stick with whatever has been confirmed to work with the V60 Velvet 

  I find myself using dual screen apps more than I thought I would  I frequently use two apps at once now that it s so convenient to do so  which is something I never really did with multi window on previous devices  Also  yes  you can use multi window on the top display while using a third app on the lower display  Have fun living on the toilet 

  Having a thin case and screen protector really helps with operating the swivel in one hand  but good luck getting your hands on any of that at the moment 

  The track pad function is an absolute game changer for remote desktop and crappy websites that still don t have a decent mobile view 

  Gimbal mode is pretty sweet  so is the pop up camera for security privacy reasons  I haven t had a ton of time with the camera  but it s decent so far  Would be willing to test out anything anyone might wanna know about 

  Battery life is        meh  It s not bad  just not fantastic  I m sure you can get a full day of regular use with no problem though 

  This thing should have dual speakers on the top and bottom of the main screen  however due to the main screen being so thin it actually just has a passthrough on the top for a speaker that s behind it  on the main body of the phone  That one is just used for calls  the media speaker is at the bottom of the device  which is kinda weird considering how far it feels from the screen when it s opened 

At this point I ll leave it up to you guys  I ll be happy to answer any questions  Overall though I have to say despite the crappy LG keyboard and  occasional  buggy ness of the dual screen  I absolutely love this thing  This is the coolest phone I ve seen since the old feature phone days  No more boring slabs of glass for me  This very well may end up being my new all time favorite phone ",Android,lg wing two week thought share detail owning like well answer question start saying always gravitated towards two type phone physical keyboard pen support like phone alternate input method like weird phone first saw image wing thought really strange almost unnecessarily weird device time went video came grew interested already discovered number interesting useful feature seen touched video well odd bug addressed first impression thing long mean loooooong boi main screen aspect ratio display result notice pocket previous phone especially driving find taking pocket placing seat longer drive big device somehow feel thick main display razor thin add much profile wing actually end feeling like normal hand lg clearly wanted pull user thing near exact stock wallpaper though actually animated wing exact navigation gesture bit behind game realize thing sorry folk extra feature like screen recording whatever else thing reek io girlfriend die hard apple fan actually said first device ever consider buying thought couple week typing second screen feel surprisingly natural always despised typing touchscreen use swipe sliding whenever man feel nice actually almost satisfies physical keyboard craving one also immediately confirmed girlfriend first question saw use lg really got weight balance feel thing right typing lower screen easy pick start using good thing next point lg keyboard suuuuuuucks like need listen default lg keyboard absolute pile manure autofill constantly fight try replace basic word fun new word lg thought might wanna sprinkle sometimes sliding eager replace word new one even decide weird replace end entering two word without even spacing neither word even wanted first place disable autofill course also disable auto capitalizing certain thing like proper noun lg please make separate option also swap keyboard another one far tell point keyboard supported second screen swivel mode default lg keyboard make thing difficult hate using lg keyboard main screen slide typing love single key typing lower screen lg please please fix god awful keyboard least let u use third party lower screen speaking input method wing support active pen input confirm wing respond bamboo ink gen pen actually pop menu drawing note know advertised feature like galaxy note slide keyboard two thing note pun intended pen input work main display lower one also surface pen old htc flyer pen use n trig work best stick whatever confirmed work v velvet find using dual screen apps thought would frequently use two apps convenient something never really multi window previous device also yes use multi window top display using third app lower display fun living toilet thin case screen protector really help operating swivel one hand good luck getting hand moment track pad function absolute game changer remote desktop crappy website still decent mobile view gimbal mode pretty sweet pop camera security privacy reason ton time camera decent far would willing test anything anyone might wanna know battery life meh bad fantastic sure get full day regular use problem though thing dual speaker top bottom main screen however due main screen thin actually passthrough top speaker behind main body one used call medium speaker bottom device kinda weird considering far feel screen opened point leave guy happy answer question overall though say despite crappy lg keyboard occasional buggy ness dual screen absolutely love thing coolest seen since old feature day boring slab glass well may end new time favorite

What this does is that it blocks ads on your entire network  so whether you are on your phone or in an app  the ads will  probably  be disabled  The drawbacks of this are that not all ads are blocked  youtube is finicky   and it requires a little common sense when it comes to computers  Luckily  there s another way   

Bringing us to Alternative Social Media Apps   There are currently many different apps for different social media platforms  almost all of which feature ad blocking  Here are the ones that I m currently using 

Note  You will need to uninstall APKs for some of these apps to work  If you don t know how to do that  check  this  https   www androidcentral com unknown sources  article out 

Youtube   Vanced  https   vancedapp com  

Blocks ads  skip sponsors using  SponsorBlock  https   chrome google com webstore detail sponsorblock for youtube mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone   download videos  and get AMOLED dark mode  all for free  They also have a youtube music app  also with no ads  and also for free 

Note on vanced  Since it is so popular  many fake websites claim to have downloads  ONLY DOWNLOAD VANCED FROM  https   vancedapp com   https   vancedapp com  

Facebook   Swipe for Facebook  https   play google com store apps details id com happening studios swipeforfacebookfree amp hl en_US amp gl US 

A clean looking Facebook interface  with every feature of the main Facebook app  plus messenger  dark mode  and Ad Blocking  for an additional one time fee   it is my personal Facebook app  and definitely worth the  5 or so to block sponsored posts 

Twitter   Owly for Twitter  https   play google com store apps details id com arthurivanets owly amp hl en_US amp gl US 

While I personally use Flamingo  an app that is now removed from the app store due to Twitter s token limit   I have tried Owly and can say that it is definitely one of the best Twitter apps  They have a great looking UI  Ad blocking  Filters  video downloading  and tons more  They do have a  3 fee to access most of the features  but again  it s definitely worth it  plus you can always get a refund if you don t like it 

Reddit   Relay for Reddit  https   play google com store apps details id free reddit news amp hl en_US amp gl US 

Reddit is a big one  and while  Apollo  https   apolloapp io   is still my all time favorite Reddit app  it s only available on IOS  so I use Relay  It has Ad Blocking  a WAY better interface and UI than the official Reddit app  and AMOLED Dark Mode  You can also scrub through videos  and it s just a generally better app than the normal one  If you like it  you can support the developer with the pro version  although there are no large differences between the pro and free versions  

Instagram   Insta aero  https   aeroinsta com    
A good looking Instagram app with Ad Blocking  photo scaling  and AMOLED dark mode  Plus much more  Please only download from  https   aeroinsta com   https   aeroinsta com  

In general  using AdGuard and Alternative Apps are a great way to save money and not have to deal with CONSTANT ADS all around us  I hope this helps some people

I ve been researching getting a new Android phone and I wanted to go for a phone in the Samsung range 

As a UK citizen  I have obviously stumbled across a lot of Exynos vs Snapdragon comparisons for the S20s but just today  I realised that there is actually a Snapdragon S20 available in the UK and all other regions where you would normally be stuck to the Exynos chip 

The  Fan Edition  5G   That s UK Store link   https   www samsung com uk smartphones galaxy s20 buy  modelCode SM G780FZBDEUA

  SD is 20  faster in app usage
  SD is 10 20 more battery efficient
  Has a more reliable fingerprint sensor  Sort of sceptical of this claim 
  Better camera shots  very sceptical of this claim 

All this time  I ve held off getting a Samsung because of the Exynos chip in the UK then they randomly drop a Fan Edition which is cheaper only last month

274,"I am returning my iPhone 12 and getting a Pixel 5 Keep in mind that I used to have the pixel 3A prior to my iPhone 12  So all my comparisons are based on that  I will be purchasing the Pixel 5  Before I begin  one thing that I will miss is the super high quality haptic feedback motor  I ve heard the one on the pixel 5 is of a lower quality intentionally to keep the phone at a lower price point  The one on the iPhone 12 is buttery smooth 

  Ignoring the issues with Face ID and my facemask  yes  i tried the half covered face while setting up face ID several times  it never worked  My phone doesn t recognize me in the morning when I m laying down in bed  No matter what angle I hold my phone at  it just doesn t register my face  I ve even tried setting up the alternate appearance while I was laying down in bed  but it didn t help  I normally wear glasses  and every now and then putting my glasses on while I m still in bed will help Face ID recognize me  but that can t seriously be a limitation that I m supposed to work around  What if I wear contacts every other day 

  My Wi Fi and cell service are significantly worse on my iPhone  I even had to turn off 5G a week into owning the iPhone because of how bad it was where I lived  The 4G LTE is slightly better but definitely not as good as the 4G LTE I used to have on my pixel 3a  Rooms in my house where are used to get Wi Fi service without any hiccups are now unusable on my iPhone  

  The iOS widgets are such a step down from the ones I used to have on android  I understand that iPhone just released their widgets  but they should ve at least been as functional or usable as the ones on android  My biggest example is the calendar widgets  While they are scrollable on my android meaning that I can view my agenda for the days ahead  the iOS ones are not useful unless I pick the biggest size  taking up the majority of my screen  Additionally  why can t I get my iOS reminders to show up on my iCal  Additionally the reminders widget only shows me my next upcoming reminder  again  unless i pick the huge size   why not show me more  Let me scroll  dammit 

  I can t believe that iOS doesn t provide a numbers bar on the main face of the keyboard  Or at least do the flicking thing that iPads let us do to use numbers and punctuation without having to switch keyboard faces  This has been a staple in android for years  

  Setting up reminders using voice has been a nightmare  Mainly when I set a reminder past midnight and Siri asks me what I meant by  tomorrow  and gives me two options  I ve tried responding with things like  the first one  or  the 31st   In the first case  it s simply ignored me and picked the second day down the list  and in the second case  it somehow decided to set up a location based reminder for when I reached some 31st street  Oh  and it set the reminder for the wrong day on top of all that 

  Sometimes  my finger just doesn t register with the screen  I d be trying to click a button and it would take me 2 to 3 tries to actually have the iPhone realize what I m trying to do  I ve never noticed such a inaccuracies in touch sensitivity when I had my pixel ",Android,returning getting pixel keep mind used pixel prior comparison based purchasing pixel begin one thing miss super high quality haptic feedback motor heard one pixel lower quality intentionally keep lower price point one buttery smooth ignoring issue face id facemask yes tried half covered face setting face id several time never worked recognize morning laying bed matter angle hold register face even tried setting alternate appearance laying bed help normally wear glass every putting glass still bed help face id recognize seriously limitation supposed work around wear contact every day wi fi cell service significantly worse even turn g week owning bad lived g lte slightly better definitely good g lte used pixel room house used get wi fi service without hiccup unusable io widget step one used understand released widget least functional usable one biggest example calendar widget scrollable meaning view agenda day ahead io one useful unless pick biggest size taking majority screen additionally get io reminder show ical additionally reminder widget show next upcoming reminder unless pick huge size show let scroll dammit believe io provide number bar main face keyboard least flicking thing ipads let u use number punctuation without switch keyboard face staple year setting reminder using voice nightmare mainly set reminder past midnight siri asks meant tomorrow give two option tried responding thing like first one st first case simply ignored picked second day list second case somehow decided set location based reminder reached st street oh set reminder wrong day top sometimes finger register screen trying click button would take try actually realize trying never noticed inaccuracy touch sensitivity pixel

279,"2 days of using the Samsung Galaxy M51 So I live in the Netherlands and the last we heard of the Galaxy M51 was in an XDA review about it that was linked in a thread here 

 amp  x200B 

The title is not misleading because I have had it for 2 days now but the last charge is from after that a bit 

I am on T Mobile here and coverage is pretty good overall for context 

So I came from a Moto G8 Power  in the US just called Moto G Power  and was constantly on the edge of buying or not buying this device  in the end I am glad I did 

Gsam battery monitor doesn t show it yet but it appears to outdo the Moto G8 Power in battery life so far  which you would think is a given seeing the 2000mah uptick and newer SoC that s made on 8nm instead of 11nm on the G8 Power s SnapDragon 665 

 Build quality 

So the phone is made from  glasstic  first of all  which honestly I prefer for durability purposes but feels kinda bad with haptic feedback  Not that it matters because I put a Spigen case on it  It s basically a glossy plastic material 

I had a Galaxy Note 9 once and I do miss the sturdiness of it s glass and metal frame  but can t have everything 

The phone is surprisingly light at 213 grams and feels nice to hold  well as far as a huge phone is nice to hold with 1 hand   The volume rocker is on the right side above the power button fingerprint scanner combo 

On the bottom left side there is a headphone jack  woohoo 

Bottom right is for a speaker grille and in the bottom middle there is a USB C port  nothing special here 

On the back there is a camera island on the left side of the phone but it is actually recessed in there so it isn t sticking out 

 Screen 

One of the main reasons I bought this phone is because I wanted to go back to an AMOLED screen 

I can say I am very pleased with the SAMOLED screen they put in  Sure colours are mostly less  natural  but that doesn t really matter to me when the blacks are actually this black  YouTube Vanced in Black theme anyone   and all other colours are popping or otherwise vibrant 

It is still a 60hz screen but that doesn t stop this party for me 

 Sound 

From earpieces or headphones the sound is fine and it s all good  nothing to complain about 

But from the bottom firing speaker the sound quality is pretty bad  it surely is serviceable but I would have expected a bit better quality at least  loudness is fine but also nothing special  The Moto G8 Power beats it here for sure   maybe there are settings that I haven t checked yet that would improve this but I d have to check 

 Haptic feedback 

Pretty bad  Sure it vibrates and everything and it does it fine but it feels a but gnarly  feels like a cheap ish motor  I can live with it though 

 Performance 

Absolutely wonderful  They put a Snapdragon 730G in this phone and together with a somewhat stripped down OneUI it does the job wonderfully 

I have had no lag during day to day operations and honestly don t expect to  I don t see how quite honestly  I don t game on my phone but benchmarks online say the same about that too  you can t go wrong with this SoC 

 Battery 

Probably the main attraction  the screenshots from the battery settings menu are on 1 charge  Gsam will say the same  it hasn t adjusted to the full capabilities of this device s battery yet  

I am very confident in saying that the vast majority of people will be able to use this phone for at least 2 days and most likely even 3

This is on mixed wifi and 4G usage  mostly 4g I d say  Adaptive screen brightness and bluelight filter at night   also filter is on while the photo is taken so that s why the hue is off 

 Camera 

I am really not a photographer of any kind but the pictures look good to me  I will update this section with actual photos later on  but supposedly this phone has a working Gcam version I found out through XDA forums 

edit  I made a comparison for nightmode vs it s normal mode in a mostly dark room  only pc screens were lit up  https   imgur com a VQQl8Tt

 Fingerprint scanner 

The fingerprint scanner on this phone is also the power button  I never would have thought that I would like it so much but I do  it s the perfect position for when you want to unlock the phone most of the time  for right handed people at least 

 Storage 

It has 128GB which I am very fine with  also expandable via MicroSD card  6GB of RAM 

 Availability 

Pretty sure it is only available in select markets  say India and some European countries like Germany and the Netherlands 

 Extra info 

This phone comes with a USB C to USB C wire and in fact allows you to charge other devices from the phone itself 

The OneUI version is OneUI core 2 1 and it is missing some Samsung features  which for me is no problem at all because I never used these features to begin with  If you need specifics I really don t have those  because again I never used them 

Phone is running Android 10 

The phone comes with wired in ear earbuds 

It is available in black or white 

Can be a fingerprint magnet due to glossy plastic 

Has a camera hole punch in the center 

Screen is 6 67 inches so be warned this phone is a chonky boi yet slimmer than you d think  

Has FM radio too 


Also I think I finally  finally  after 3 4 years  found a phone that can really go toe to toe with the legendary Lenovo P2 s battery life without sacrificing anything and in fact improving

283,Pixel 5 vs iPhone night mode showdown  ,Android,pixel v night mode showdown
284,"Switched from Pixel 4 XL to Pixel 5  It s not an upgrade or downgrade  I bought Pixel 4 XL on release date last year and have been happy with the phone since  

Note   I have hard hearing so I heavily use the Live Transcribe and Live Captions daily  

My work phone needed an upgrade and Pixel 5 happened to release at perfect timing so I pre ordered one and it arrived 2 days ago  


GAP  Yes the Pixel 5 has a gap  however  the gap is less than 1mm and uniform around the entire phone  Defect or not  on the unit I received it is not an issue  Some specks of dust does get in though  


SCREEN  Ok the screen is 6 inches vs 6 3 inches  small difference right  Not exactly  The difference is bigger than I expected  mainly because of the top of the Pixel 5 screen is unusable due to hole punch camera which is a big circle  much bigger than Galaxy S10 hole punch   When I use apps or anything  the entire area the camera hole covers is not useable  On Pixel 4 XL the digital time on top left would appear and disappear and you can use the full screen  On Pixel 5 it s just a blank if you want the clock gone  


BUILD QUALITY  Pixel 4 XL is better  This isn t hard to compare as the phone was priced more premium as well  In actual in hand feel  Pixel 4 XL feels much more  solid   A weird comparison of this is  have you ever tapped or slapped a hard plastic container of hair gel  Well I have  it has a slight tingle when you do    Pixel 5 has such tingle as well when I tap or slap the phone  Pixel 4 XL in comparison feels like a marble slab  much more solid  I m sure you all already know how the texture of Pixel 4 XL feels in hand by now  Pixel 5 feels different  it can be good or bad  It s a preference thing  Curious  Go to the kitchen and touch your Anodized frying pan  Feels like that but instead of metal surface    It feels more like textured adhesive wrap applied to plastic  I dropped my Pixel 5 onto wooden floors yesterday  not a scratch or mark on it  Maybe plasticky isn t so bad  Phone most certainly doesn t feel like a  700 device and I doubt I ll put a case on it  It s not glass or pretty metal  


HAPTIC FEEDBACK  It s good enough but not amazing  I think it has something to do with how light and tingly the Pixel 5 is  Remember I compared is to a container of hair gel  Haptics not such a big deal to me though  long as it s there then that s good enough  Phone just feels hollow  


PERFORMANCE  Not much difference as far as I can tell  Sorry  I can t really test the speakers anyway  


BATTERY LIFE  Pixel 5 battery is nothing short of phenomenal  There s no comparison compared to Pixel 4 XL  If you re having battery issues on Pixel 4 XL then switching to Pixel 5 would be more than worth it  


Ok I think so far  I kept making the Pixel 5 sound bad but it s really not  People keep comparing the Pixel 5 to Pixel 4 XL but that s not a fair comparison  Pixel 4 XL cost  200 more in US at release  


So if you have a Pixel 4 XL and wondering if you should upgrade  consider 3 things  battery life  physical size of the phone and Fingerprint sensor  Battery is amazing  not much to say about that  Physical size of Pixel 5 is really good  very easily one handed  similar size to iPhone 8 with a slim case  I mention this because Pixel 4 XL with a case is a gigantic monster of a phone  Fingerprint sensor doesn t need much of an explanation with this pandemic ",Android,switched pixel xl pixel upgrade downgrade bought pixel xl release date last year happy since note hard hearing heavily use live transcribe live caption daily work needed upgrade pixel happened release perfect timing pre ordered one arrived day ago gap yes pixel gap however gap le mm uniform around entire defect unit received issue speck dust get though screen ok screen inch v inch small difference right exactly difference bigger expected mainly top pixel screen unusable due hole punch camera big circle much bigger galaxy hole punch use apps anything entire area camera hole cover useable pixel xl digital time top left would appear disappear use full screen pixel blank want clock gone build quality pixel xl better hard compare priced premium well actual hand feel pixel xl feel much solid weird comparison ever tapped slapped hard plastic container hair gel well slight tingle pixel tingle well tap slap pixel xl comparison feel like marble slab much solid sure already know texture pixel xl feel hand pixel feel different good bad preference thing curious go kitchen touch anodized frying pan feel like instead metal surface feel like textured adhesive wrap applied plastic dropped pixel onto wooden floor yesterday scratch mark maybe plasticky bad certainly feel like device doubt put case glass pretty metal haptic feedback good enough amazing think something light tingly pixel remember compared container hair gel haptics big deal though long good enough feel hollow performance much difference far tell sorry really test speaker anyway battery life pixel battery nothing short phenomenal comparison compared pixel xl battery issue pixel xl switching pixel would worth ok think far kept making pixel sound bad really people keep comparing pixel pixel xl fair comparison pixel xl cost u release pixel xl wondering upgrade consider thing battery life physical size fingerprint sensor battery amazing much say physical size pixel really good easily one handed similar size slim case mention pixel xl case gigantic monster fingerprint sensor need much explanation pandemic

287,"One thing YouTube Music does better than Play Music I am not happy about switching from Play Music and have been putting off the switch for as long as possible  But this week my Play Music would no cast from my phone to my speakers so I decided to just give in and make the transfer  While I still miss Play Music I do like one thing 

I can connect to the queue from multiple devices  If I cast from the YouTube Music app on one phone I can connect to the speaker group on another phone and it will pull up the currently active queue and I can manage it from both devices at once without having to go to the Google Home app 

You do have to make sure there is no current queue on that second device though  whether active or inactive  You can just swipe down and it will close out that queue  Otherwise the second device s queue will take over the cast 

Everything else sucks though ",Android,one thing youtube music better play music happy switching play music putting switch long possible week play music would cast speaker decided give make transfer still miss play music like one thing connect queue multiple device cast youtube music app one connect speaker group another pull currently active queue manage device without go google home app make sure current queue second device though whether active inactive swipe close queue otherwise second device queue take cast everything else suck though

290,"I tested the Pixel 4XL against the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro in low light  Here are the results  Last year  the iPhone 11 dramatically improved the camera by introducing Night Mode and Deep Fusion and in my opinion  pretty much caught up with Pixel phones  So  I was pretty excited to see if Apple made any drastic improvements to the camera performance  especially in low light  So  I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro to find out  After shooting a bunch of photos in the city at night  here are my thoughts 

I only shot handheld and didn t use any third party apps  Also  in most places  I took the same photo with my iPhone 11 Pro and my Pixel 4 XL to see how it compared to the older generation  It s possible to get much better photos on a tripod as shutter speeds are slower at night  but most of us aren t walking around with tripods on a normal night  so I just wanted this test to reflect the normal experience 

 Here are the photos for reference   https   youtu be JQ 8L2AyI14 t 116   video with side by side comparison 

Here is a  Google Drive folder  https   drive google com drive folders 1I55p2swJvxZJ7J Lwo_cWAK3XWwOBbXS usp sharing  with all original photos 

When shooting with the main wide angle camera  in most cases  the photos from the 11 Pro looked identical to the 12 Pro and I had to double check the folders multiple times because I myself was getting confused while going through everything  The photos on the 12 Pro are generally a bit brighter with slightly more details in the shadows  But you could easily fool me by increasing the exposure slightly on the 11 Pro  When comparing with the Pixel 4XL  I noticed the Pixel tends to take slightly cooler shots with a bit more contrast  and in my opinion it s a bit better  Both the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro lean a bit more towards warmer tones overall 

The ultra wide camera is where the differences start to become more apparent  The 11 Pro doesn t have night mode on the ultra wide  which leads to almost unusable photos in low light unless you use a longer shutter with a third party app  The 12 Pro has the same camera  but due to night mode  the difference is night and day  Because the sensor isn t as big as the main camera  even with night mode  the photos are pretty mediocre  I d say use this lens in low light with a stand or if you have no other option  The Pixel 4XL doesn t have an ultra wide camera  so no comparisons here 

Apple is being very sneaky with the night mode on the 2x lens  I was under the impression that the telephoto camera also had night mode  But when I looked at the metadata  I saw that the aperture was at 1 6 on the 12 Pro and 1 8 on the 11 Pro  which means the iPhones use the primary camera and then digitally zoom in for the 2x zoom in most cases  This is pretty misleading on Apple s end  While the Pixel 4XL also switches back to the primary camera in extreme cases  it still uses the 2x camera most times  The photos from the iPhone 12 Pro and 11 Pro at 2x are usable and the quality is quite close to the Pixel as the primary camera has a bigger sensor  But  when I take photos at 5x  things become pretty clear  The Pixel outperforms both iPhones by quite a bit margin 

In the iPhone 12  Apple also introduced night mode to portrait mode  I tested this in a controlled setting on all three phones  The Pixel zoomed in when switching to portrait mode and had a lot of noise in the photo  The edge detection was fine  but not that impressive  especially around the hair  The iPhone 11 Pro did a pretty good job  but because it doesn t have night mode in portrait mode  the photos aren t as bright  Also  I noticed that edge detection was not as good as the iPhone 12 Pro  The iPhone 12 Pro did a fantastic job in this department  Even though I was backlit  it was able to fill the light thanks to night mode and the slightly bigger aperture  The bloom from the lights behind me was reflected in a pretty realistic way and the edges also looked pretty natural thanks to LIDAR 

When I switched to the front camera  the differences got much smaller  Both the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro look almost identical in terms of quality and edge detection as there s no LIDAR sensor on the front  The Pixel did pretty well here and I prefer the wider angle of the Pixel  Edge detection isn t perfect here either  but I like the cooler colours  None of the phones are perfect when taking portraits using the front camera in low light and it really comes down to personal preference 

One big issue I have with Apple s cameras is the lens flare I got in almost all my photos with lights directly facing the camera  It led to a lot of dots where there were multiple lights  which can be pretty distracting  I hope Apple fixes this in the future generations either through hardware or software improvements 

  Final Thoughts  

I was pleasantly surprised by how well the Pixel 4XL kept up with both iPhones  Photos from the Pixel are amazing in low light and in a lot of cases  better than the iPhone  Also  while the Pixel also gets lens flares  it s not nearly as bad as the iPhone 

Google has done wonders with computational photography and I am really looking forward to new camera hardware next year  fingers crossed  ",Android,tested pixel xl pro pro low light result last year dramatically improved camera introducing night mode deep fusion opinion pretty much caught pixel phone pretty excited see apple made drastic improvement camera performance especially low light went ahead bought pro find shooting bunch photo city night thought shot handheld use third party apps also place took photo pro pixel xl see compared older generation possible get much better photo tripod shutter speed slower night u walking around tripod normal night wanted test reflect normal experience photo reference http youtu jq l ayi video side side comparison google drive folder http drive google drive folder p swjvxzj j lwo cwak xwwobbxs usp sharing original photo shooting main wide angle camera case photo pro looked identical pro double check folder multiple time getting confused going everything photo pro generally bit brighter slightly detail shadow could easily fool increasing exposure slightly pro comparing pixel xl noticed pixel tends take slightly cooler shot bit contrast opinion bit better pro pro lean bit towards warmer tone overall ultra wide camera difference start become apparent pro night mode ultra wide lead almost unusable photo low light unless use longer shutter third party app pro camera due night mode difference night day sensor big main camera even night mode photo pretty mediocre say use lens low light stand option pixel xl ultra wide camera comparison apple sneaky night mode x lens impression telephoto camera also night mode looked metadata saw aperture pro pro mean use primary camera digitally zoom x zoom case pretty misleading apple end pixel xl also switch back primary camera extreme case still us x camera time photo pro pro x usable quality quite close pixel primary camera bigger sensor take photo x thing become pretty clear pixel outperforms quite bit margin apple also introduced night mode portrait mode tested controlled setting three phone pixel zoomed switching portrait mode lot noise photo edge detection fine impressive especially around hair pro pretty good job night mode portrait mode photo bright also noticed edge detection good pro pro fantastic job department even though backlit able fill light thanks night mode slightly bigger aperture bloom light behind reflected pretty realistic way edge also looked pretty natural thanks lidar switched front camera difference got much smaller pro pro look almost identical term quality edge detection lidar sensor front pixel pretty well prefer wider angle pixel edge detection perfect either like cooler colour none phone perfect taking portrait using front camera low light really come personal preference one big issue apple camera lens flare got almost photo light directly facing camera led lot dot multiple light pretty distracting hope apple fix future generation either hardware software improvement final thought pleasantly surprised well pixel xl kept photo pixel amazing low light lot case better also pixel also get lens flare nearly bad google done wonder computational photography really looking forward new camera hardware next year finger crossed

  It s tiny when compared to today s phones  Plus the trackball looks cute  other than that it helps when you select text on a 3 7  screen 
  Instead of running Stock 2 3 6  it runs CyanogenMod 7 2  Notable differences include the ability to tweak low level system settings like CPU speed and cache compression 
  Mine has an SLCD screen  Compared to my A50 it looks    alright  I rarely use the screen as it serves as a music player FM Radio 
  On the other hand  the FM radio is quite crackly  Maybe it s because I dropped it into my drawer by mistake  It s still a great way to pass the time 
  With the 1GHz processor and 512MB RAM  not to mention the   200MB storage  GApps would choke this device  I opted to leave them off for this reason 
  The modern web is out of reach of this device  Security certificate warnings EVERYWHERE  Not to mention the security holes from 2 3 x Android   
  Picking up this phone makes you feel the cold metal 

Next up  my Galaxy A50

  This device runs Android 10  it ll get Android 11 come next year  It s a big deal  this was the only device that wasn t already EOL past the update cycle or a hand me down when I got it  In some cases getting un updated second hand stuff or two year old devices necessitates downloading firmware updates off the manufacturer s site and flashing them manually  Other times  you re SOL 
  Building on that  I mourn the lack of custom ROMs for this device  They extended the life of my phones  which was important when you ve got something from the last two years 
  I like the inclusion of the 3 5mm jack and SD card slot  They re super useful 
  64GB storage  non expanded  4GB RAM  I never run anything intensive and enjoy living my life 3 apps at a time  because it s what I always did 
  9160 Exynos  Excellent for basic web browsing  calls and texts  plus the simple light games I play 
  This device has an FM radio  but I haven t tested it yet 
  A 4000mah battery means I can go days without charging  Non replaceable isn t too much of an issue  After all my last phone before this had a non replaceable battery 
  For a phone camera  if it takes something halfway decent  it s fine  I have no real intention to snap holiday snappers with phone cams anytime soon

I ve had this LG V60 for a little over 2 months and this battery life is amazing 

Today  15 hours off charger with almost 9 hours of screen on time  Plus youtube podcasts during the day and over an hour on amazon video for my 3 yr old while we were in line for a halloween thing  After all that  still at 28  battery with 6 hrs of usable time left  And this is every day while still using the phone for work too 

My only gripe is the keyboard  The native LG keyboard doesn t have great suggestions when you re typing fast  Just switch to the google keyboard and thats fixed

320,"Device review OnePlus 8T 5G  KB2007  daily driver Let me start off by saying I m coming from a rooted OnePlus 7 pro that I had for over a year  And I switched to the 8T 5G as a daily driver a week ago  Here are my thoughts   

Display  5 out 5 amazing
Let me start by reviewing the display  this was my most hyped feature the 120 HZ display coming from the 90 that I already liked I was excited for the 120  First thing out of the box I compared my 7 pro to the 8T just by swiping around playing with the home screen and I saw an immediate difference I loved it  I also use a tool  jOnePlus Tools  app to force 120 all the time  I am not a heavy phone gamer but the little bit of games I do play I love seeing high refresh rates because it just makes everything so creamy smooth  I m loving the flat screen I hate curved screens 

Connectivity  3 5 out of 5 meh
 not bad not amazing difference
I don t live in a major city but I when I have been in the city I didn t notice a huge boost of speeds but checking with speed tests at various locations I ve seen roughly 50 to 350 megabits down and a consistent 20ish up 

Hardware  4 out of 5 pretty sweet
I really like using my phone as a connected android auto for my vehicles head unit and I have a bluetooth connected cobra radar detector so my phone screen is on for radar detector plus phone running AA screen with music and maps running  Now on my rooted 7Pro  this would heat my device and drain it while it was plugged in like it was going out of style  so much so I built a makeshift cooler using one of my air vents and cover for my dash mount to keep it out of the sun  Using this same setup I don t even need my air conditioning running and the 8T stays decently cooled  not cold but definitely not hot without my ac running in my car  I also love the 12gb ram  on my 7pro I usually ran with about 2gb to spare on idle and I never quite liked that it was so little  This is coming from the pc gamer that put 32gb of ram in his pc back in 2016 thinking it might not be enough    

Battery  3 out of 5 pretty disappointed 
It doesn t last all day
Let me start by saying that I think this could be a lot better if I had this rooted and was able to properly debloat it  But as of now that s not an option and my review stands  With or without heavy use it does drain fairly fast during the day for me  I only have a couple of apps that are not battery optimized  basically the same setup I had on my 7Pro but without rooted apps and it did last all day with heavy use  I also suspect that forcing 120hz all day makes a difference as well but only time will tell  I also make a point to never fast charge my devices because I want the batteries to last as long as possible so minimal heat


Camera  5 out of 5
It s just a great camera just like the 7 pro


Overall a 4 out of 5
So far it s been a good successor to my 7pro 

Ask me about any other details you d like to know

321,"Google spamming users via the Play Store app I recently got an unwanted ad notification  aka spam  from the Play Store app  It was about Google Play Points in combination with Pokemon Go  an app I never used  I had notifications for marketing purposes disabled in the app   
So  naturally I contacted the Google support and was more than surprised to actually get an answer  But it isn t a pleasant experience to deal with the support  First they tried to deflect it by claiming it might be another app displaying notification spam  And after back and forth and a screenshot they now realized it was indeed the Play Store   
Their solution  disable all notifications for the Play Store   

So  basically their own support asks you to cripple their own app  by deactivating all notification  even the helpful ones of this crucial system app  to get rid of notification spam that Google itself sends out by ignoring the marketing settings of the user  Great 

Has anyone else also got this spam  I can t be the only one ",Android,google spamming user via play store app recently got unwanted ad notification aka spam play store app google play point combination pokemon go app never used notification marketing purpose disabled app naturally contacted google support surprised actually get answer pleasant experience deal support first tried deflect claiming might another app displaying notification spam back forth screenshot realized indeed play store solution disable notification play store basically support asks cripple app deactivating notification even helpful one crucial system app get rid notification spam google sends ignoring marketing setting user great anyone else also got spam one

335,"Warning  Possible bug in built in file manager could cause data loss when moving files  Note  This is   not   a support request  but I just wanted to share it here as a warning  and I am  not the first user  https   support google com photos thread 106201 hl en  to experience this 

    

As we know  Google sadly has pretty much locked down the file system to third party applications over the years  starting in 2014 and then deterioating over time  citing security reasons  rather than giving users options to grant selected applications access for  data portability  https   en wikipedia org wiki Data_portability Mobile_devices  purposes  forcing users to use their precluded tools that sometimes are not good enough  to say it politely  

While I moved files from the internal storage to a USB OTG flash drive  using Google s precluded file manager  the space storage on the target flash drive got exhausted  aborting the file transfer 

However  the photos that were not moved yet   got deleted   from the source  internal storage   because apparently a bug in the file manager caused it to delete all source files  thinking they were already transferred  while they were not yet 

And because they were stored on the internal storage  rather than MicroSD   they are  near impossible to recover   https   en everybodywiki com Benefits_of_expandable_storage Data_recovery 

My advice  Always copy verify delete rather than moving  Or use an FTP home server for file transfering 

I hope my warning will do good for you

360," Review  Samsung Galaxy Tab S7   A perfect balance between fantastic and fine  I was GOING to post this on Samsungs Website  but they hada character limit of half of this post so    here it is 

Overall  the tablets build is amazing  The quality of the build is absolutely worth the asking price  but android software feels only 85  ready for Samsung s ideas  SEE DEX BELOW  

The metal outside feels sturdy with no compromises  The camera bump is very annoying when using the tablet flat on the table without a case  which I prefer to do when casually using the device because it feels great in the hand  That stupid bump makes me scared to use the s pen for notes or drawing because I don t want to scratch the crap out of the sensor  

The screen is by far the best thing about the tablet  The 120 FPS is such a welcome addition  I cant speak on the colors  calibration only bothers me when it s completely out of whack  This has quickly become my favorite content consumption device 

My use case was for personal use and school use  with video calls happening more frequently  and the front facing cameras and mics are totally adequate for that  The back camera is surprisingly good with a quick autofocus for scanning my documents  

DEX is spectacular  Its sososososososo close to replacing my windows laptop  I believe a few more user options and QOL improvements are needed  but Samsung is essentially building a new infrastructure for Android with DEX   After hours of use  I can say their hard work definitely paying off  Im sure only a fraction of users will ever fully utilize the potential of the power DEX software but for those who DO use it can attest to the versatility  

I have the 256 8GB RAM model   If you get a trade in or student discount  full send and buy this tablet if you re on the edge  If you just have an itch for cool tech  let the price drop before jumping on a deal ",Android,review samsung galaxy tab perfect balance fantastic fine going post samsungs website hada character limit half post overall tablet build amazing quality build absolutely worth asking price software feel ready samsung idea see dex metal outside feel sturdy compromise camera bump annoying using tablet flat table without case prefer casually using device feel great hand stupid bump make scared use pen note drawing want scratch crap sensor screen far best thing tablet fps welcome addition cant speak color calibration bother completely whack quickly become favorite content consumption device use case personal use school use video call happening frequently front facing camera mics totally adequate back camera surprisingly good quick autofocus scanning document dex spectacular sososososososo close replacing window laptop believe user option qol improvement needed samsung essentially building new infrastructure dex hour use say hard work definitely paying im sure fraction user ever fully utilize potential power dex software use attest versatility gb ram model get trade student discount full send buy tablet edge itch cool tech let price drop jumping deal

374," REVIEW  Samsung S20FE from a pixel 3A and after 7 years of Google phones It s been 48 hours since I picked received my S20FE  This is my first non Google phone as I ve had the nexus 5 6p  pixel 2 RIP fell in the ocean  and the 3A 

  THE GOOD  
I must say the turquoise color is really nice and this thing looks great and is not  cheap  feeling at all 

The screen is gorgeous  even for a phone that s not a  flagship  it s beautiful  

The camera seems to be great  I haven t used it much as I ve been fishing a lot and I don t want to get this phone all dirty if I end up returning it   but ill update the post with a picture  It s super fast unlike my pixel 3a taking forever to render HDR 

The screen protector is a nice touch however it doesn t take up the whole screen 

  THE BAD  
I ll start with my biggest gripe 

  The SOFTWARE  

I really don t get Samsung s software and OS layout  I ve been into technology for over 15 years and I feel like Samsung went back in time  

There s no only on display notifications like my google phones  I cannot double tap to open notifications and everything has such a busy feeling  I feel like Samsung is trying to take over my life  I understand how people say stock google phones are like iPhones  to be honest  is this a bad thing 

Every Google phone has migrated easily  keeping wifi passwords and such that I entered years ago  It s like starting from scratch  The data migration tool worked okay but not as nice as Google to Google  I don t get why Samsung has to make all their own apps over Google s  They could probably charge less if they didn t spend so much time making thier own apps   What s wrong with the Google clock and such 




  The fingerprint reader  
Frankly  it sucks and I think Google nailed the location with it s reader on the back  I can reach into my pocket and have the screen open easier  Only three fingerprints is odd as well   most of us have 10 fingers and I don t understand why not have a higher amount 

The worst part is it s not great at recognizing my fingers  After catching a few fish my finger was a little  beat up  and it would not work  I had my old phone with me and it worked instantly  on a phone that s half the price      

The battery is so far worse than my pixel 3a which is one thing I really didn t think would be the case  On that note  the silicone case from Samsung is a lint magnet and isn t going to last me until Christmas 

No fast charger in the box  actually it comes with a usb A C cable  5 hours 28 minutes is the ETA from 28 100  as I type this  


The OnePlus 8T is on display at the t mobile store near me and I m going to check it out  I might give that a shot  It s a shame because this phone was  430 after my discount and trade in  I think I m going to sell the 3a on swappa and get a pixel 5 on black friday ",Android,review samsung fe pixel year google phone hour since picked received fe first non google nexus p pixel rip fell ocean good must say turquoise color really nice thing look great cheap feeling screen gorgeous even flagship beautiful camera seems great used much fishing lot want get dirty end returning ill update post picture super fast unlike pixel taking forever render hdr screen protector nice touch however take whole screen bad start biggest gripe software really get samsung software o layout technology year feel like samsung went back time display notification like google phone cannot double tap open notification everything busy feeling feel like samsung trying take life understand people say stock google phone like honest bad thing every google migrated easily keeping wifi password entered year ago like starting scratch data migration tool worked okay nice google google get samsung make apps google could probably charge le spend much time making thier apps wrong google clock fingerprint reader frankly suck think google nailed location reader back reach pocket screen open easier three fingerprint odd well u finger understand higher amount worst part great recognizing finger catching fish finger little beat would work old worked instantly half price battery far worse pixel one thing really think would case note silicone case samsung lint magnet going last christmas fast charger box actually come usb c cable hour minute eta type oneplus display mobile store near going check might give shot shame discount trade think going sell swappa get pixel black friday

401,"Hear me out in why the Asus zenfone 7 7pro is the 2020 masterpiece There are several smartphones releasing every month and it doesn t matter if it s a midrange or a flagship  there is always a degree of compromise that you are forced to accept except for this device which is an absolute killer 

What s unique about this device is that it combines AMOLED display with the side mounted fingerprint sensor which makes unlocking the phone a one button process on top of a big 5000mah battery with decent fast charging  

The camera mechanism is nothing less of innovation  While the popup mechanism might get replaced by under display cameras soon enough  the flip camera stands unique since it basically repurposes the rear camera for selfies and video calling resulting in exceptional front camera quality  

On top of everything  the UI seems to be in line with aosp  As an android developer  asus has junk free  prompt releasing of kernel source which makes it even better unlike other oems that try hard to screw aosp for no reason  With regards to the indisplay fingerprint sensor  aosp implementation of that doesn t exist and it makes the traditional rear side mounted fingerprint sensors better for custom roms since it s less difficult to implement  

 It s less expensive than other flagships out there but it s still expensive on a consumer perspective  I hope asus can bring this package to a device with affordable chipset to compete with the chinese alternatives ",Android,hear asus zenfone pro masterpiece several smartphones releasing every month matter midrange flagship always degree compromise forced accept except device absolute killer unique device combine amoled display side mounted fingerprint sensor make unlocking one button process top big mah battery decent fast charging camera mechanism nothing le innovation popup mechanism might get replaced display camera soon enough flip camera stand unique since basically repurposes rear camera selfies video calling resulting exceptional front camera quality top everything ui seems line aosp developer asus junk free prompt releasing kernel source make even better unlike oems try hard screw aosp reason regard indisplay fingerprint sensor aosp implementation exist make traditional rear side mounted fingerprint sensor better custom rom since le difficult implement le expensive flagship still expensive consumer perspective hope asus bring package device affordable chipset compete chinese alternative

407,"I got the Portrait Light update today in Google Photos  Here are my thoughts after I testing it on over a hundred different types of photos  One of the best things about Google Pixel phones is that you get most  if not all the software features new Pixel phones get  For example  Google rolled out Night Sight to older generations 

Similarly  this year  Google announced a very intriguing feature called Portrait Light in Google Photos with the launch of the Pixel 5  Less than a month after the announcement  the feature is now rolling out to older generations  I got the update today on my Pixel 4 XL 

   What is Portrait Light 

Portrait Light lets you augment your photos with a studio light like effect  It s similar to portrait mode lighting we ve seen in other devices  but on a whole new level  allowing you to change the direction and intensity of your light source after you ve taken the photo 

The best thing about portrait light is that you can use it with any photos  It doesn t have to be taken on a Pixel phone 

To use portrait light  simply go into Google Photos  open a photo you d like to add Portrait Light to  press the edit button and then go into adjust  Then select Portrait Light to add the light source 

You can drag the circle to adjust the direction of the light and you can also adjust the intensity of the light through the bottom slider  You can also tap and hold to view the before and after results   Here s a demonstration   https   youtu be y8z4E_tBhp4 t 70 

There are a couple things you should keep in mind while using portrait lighting  It only works when it detects a face and it only does that when your face is taking up a considerable part of the frame  If you don t see the option to select portrait light on the photo you are trying this on  you can crop the photo to force it to detect it the face  and then use the effect  Also  it doesn t work if your subject s entire face isn t visible  You can t use it if your subject is looking to the side in your photo 

Another thing I noticed was that even when you do have a tight frame  if there is a lot going on in the background  the app won t recognize your face for Portrait Light  This sucks as even cropping the photo won t guarantee that you can apply the effect 

The feature works on both colour and black and white photos and the lighting effect you get is quite realistic  even creating shadows depending on the angle of the light  This is great to give your photos a bit more depth and to fill in some light where needed 

In terms of improvements  I d love to be able to control how widespread the light is  Right now  it only lets users control the intensity and angle  Also  I hope the app gets update to work with wider angles and gets better at recognizing faces  Sometimes  the context in a portrait is lost with tight framing 

Apart from that  it s a solid feature and a much welcome addition to the Pixel line and I hope Google rolls this out to all Android phones ",Android,got portrait light update today google photo thought testing hundred different type photo one best thing google pixel phone get software feature new pixel phone get example google rolled night sight older generation similarly year google announced intriguing feature called portrait light google photo launch pixel le month announcement feature rolling older generation got update today pixel xl portrait light portrait light let augment photo studio light like effect similar portrait mode lighting seen device whole new level allowing change direction intensity light source taken photo best thing portrait light use photo taken pixel use portrait light simply go google photo open photo like add portrait light press edit button go adjust select portrait light add light source drag circle adjust direction light also adjust intensity light bottom slider also tap hold view result demonstration http youtu z e tbhp couple thing keep mind using portrait lighting work detects face face taking considerable part frame see option select portrait light photo trying crop photo force detect face use effect also work subject entire face visible use subject looking side photo another thing noticed even tight frame lot going background app recognize face portrait light suck even cropping photo guarantee apply effect feature work colour black white photo lighting effect get quite realistic even creating shadow depending angle light great give photo bit depth fill light needed term improvement love able control widespread light right let user control intensity angle also hope app get update work wider angle get better recognizing face sometimes context portrait lost tight framing apart solid feature much welcome addition pixel line hope google roll phone

421,"File transfer between MacOs and Android phones File transfer between MacOs and Android phones 

Every few months  I have a particularly big file or a large number of files i need to transfer between my macbook and my s10  and then i find myself in this rabbithole of trying to find the best wired file transfer program to move stuff onto and off my phone  

So here we go  

1  Android file transfer  This unmaintained pos software can go burn in hell  Slow to work  often crashes the device  honestly really poor even when it does work  do not use  

2   for the more tech savy  ADB   you can push or pull files via adb even remotely at this point if you wanted to  but it s not as plug and play as what I m looking for 

3  Mac Droid   honestly exactly what I want  

     you can edit android files on mac without having to copy them onto your computer 

     you don t need to do any real setup  

     it works will all devices  a lot of softwares don t work with samsung because of some FUSE issue   

     It just appears as a mounted phone in your finder and you can do what you want  

   But alas  tis but a dream because for some reason this is a subscription software     I would be willing to pay for it  but i m sure as hell not willing to pay monthly for it  There s a free version but ht does t let you copy files from your mac to your phone  and who the hell needs that right  

4  Handshaker   sketchy chinese software but honestly it works   i wish it were more OS integrated like Mac Droid but i guess we can t eat our cake and have it too  

5  Samsung Smartswitch   i mean i guess  but it s clunky and not designed for this as its primary purpose   or atleast i hope it s not because god damn  

Soooo does anybody have anything better  Please  or am I alone here in this cave

6  OpenMTP   honestly also a perfect solution  except it doesn t work with Samsung phones  They re working on it though  so I m watching their career with great interest 

Stuff people have mentioned in this thread 

7  Sodotu KDE connect   I v actually used this before  but not as a USB cable based file transfer protocol  I m a fan   unfortunately  it doesn t play well with campus based or work based wifi networks for me

8  Programs like snap drop  pushbullet  airdrop  and join are alright  but they re constrained to individual  smaller files and or don t work well with enterprise style wifi networks

430,"How to get Timely working on Android 10  This is basically the solution to the locked topic  https   www reddit com r GooglePixel comments czlf0z timely _alarm _on _android _10  https   www reddit com r GooglePixel comments czlf0z timely_alarm_on_android_10  utm_source share amp utm_medium web2x amp context 3  which was since locked 

Basically what we need is to modify Timely to include the new permission  START_ACTIVITIES_FROM_BACKGROUND 

This is not entirely trivial but manageable 

  Download ADB for your system  On Linux you can usually do  sudo apt get install adb 
  Install APKTOOL according to instructions from  https   ibotpeaches github io Apktool install   https   ibotpeaches github io Apktool install  
  Install APKSigner  e g   sudo apt get install apksigner 
  Semi Optional  Download ApkSign from e g   http   www mediafire com  gs6n10oh09c039n  http   www mediafire com  gs6n10oh09c039n   you only need the key pk8 and certificate pem  or create those yourself 
  Make sure to enable ADB access in developer options
     To enable developer options go to Settings  gt About and tap  Build number  about 8 times till you get the notification
     In System  gt Developer options enable  Android debugging 
  Install timely from Play Store
  Find out the installed location of the APK   adb shell pm path ch bitspin timely 
  Pull the APK to your PC using the output from above   adb pull  data app ch bitspin timely  lt some chars gt  base apk 
  Decompile   apktool d base apk 
  Edit the  AndroidManifest xml  inside the created folder  likely name  base   and add a line   lt uses permission android name  android permission START_ACTIVITIES_FROM_BACKGROUND   gt   below the other similar lines  above    the   lt application      
  Repack   apktool b timely  o timely android10 apk   older versions might not need the   o  
  Make sure you have the key pk8 and certificate pem in the current folder  or enter full paths in the next command
  Sign   apksigner sign   key key pk8   cert certificate pem timely android10 apk   Other options are possible depending on they key you d like to use  see  apksigner sign   help  
  Replace installed Timely by the patched one
      adb uninstall ch bitspin timely 
      adb install timely android10 apk   This may trigger some warnings on your phone which you can dismiss 

This should be enough to make it work  To be safe battery optimizations should be turned off too 

  Settings   gt  Search for  Optimize Battery  or  Akku Optimierung  or similar and select
  At the top select  All apps 
  Go to Timely and select  not optimized  for it

437,"What is your favorite gimmick on an Android phone  Over the years  many manufacturers have introduced new features that many have called gimmicks  Many of these are done on a few phones  and just as quickly as they appear  they disappear  However  many of us absolutely love some of the gimmicks that have come out  despite them not catching on in the general market 

Personally  I have had an HTC Evo 3D  which featured a 3D camera  and glasses free 3D screen  I currently own an LG G8X with a dual screen  While LG is pushing their dual screen phones currently  and Microsoft also released one  it s pretty clear to me that these won t be the future  and most people don t have a need for a second screen 

However  we have seen phones with projectors built into them  phones with gamepads integrated into them  O2 meters built into phones  IR blasters built into phones  and all kinds of attempts to create new  must have features     Obviously  it s hard to really define what is  and is not a gimmick  but just use your best judgment here  If the feature completely disappeared after a generation or two  it s probably a gimmick  If it s something that the general market didn t seem to care about at all  like say Samsung s DEX feature  Probably a gimmick ",Android,favorite gimmick year many manufacturer introduced new feature many called gimmick many done phone quickly appear disappear however many u absolutely love gimmick come despite catching general market personally htc evo featured camera glass free screen currently lg g x dual screen lg pushing dual screen phone currently microsoft also released one pretty clear future people need second screen however seen phone projector built phone gamepads integrated meter built phone ir blaster built phone kind attempt create new must feature obviously hard really define gimmick use best judgment feature completely disappeared generation two probably gimmick something general market seem care like say samsung dex feature probably gimmick

439,"Is the Samsung Galaxy S21 being released in January  and why  Rumours from old hands in leaks such as Onleaks and IceUniverse have strongly pointed to a January launch of the latest incarnation of Samsung s flagship phones   the Galaxy S21 series  

Whilst it may seem puzzling why they would do this  I have a few theories if these rumours come true  

Having the latest version of Android only on your flagship  then rolling out the update to previous years phones increases the perceived exclusivity of the phone 

With people updating from the S20 S10 or similar  if they have the latest version of Android and OneUi before the release of the S21  the experience may feel a bit deflating  

With new phones often having only incremental improvements year on year  going from an older phone with the same Android and UI build might not feel like an out of the box improvement at all for people who upgrade regularly  

Moving the release to January frees Samsung to continue speeding up their update schedule  without stepping on the toes of the latest flagship phones  

It also allows the Note series to be pushed up to around June  which alleviates a nagging concern for buyers of the Note  and that is the current very short window from  release to a newer version of Android being launched  

Having a good six months between release of the Note and the expected Android update from Samsung means that Note buyers won t be complaining about wasting an update cycle  

Another positive for Samsung if this rumour is true  is the competition from the iPhone  

Apple usually releases their incredibly popular phone around October  

The rumours and leaks of the Galaxy S series that would be launching in just over two months after iPhone release   may give some people switching operating systems a moment of hesitation  and perhaps sway some to consider holding off from purchase to see what Samsung has to offer in a few months  

The opposite mind games may apply to the Note if released in June  It would now be released four months before the hype and marketing kicks in for the new iPhone   making it an easier choice for those that switch between operating systems  

At this stage the rumours are just rumours  and the moving of the release date of the Galaxy S series may not eventuate at all

440,"Motorola Atrix 4G   Looking Back at How Far We ve Come  I found my old Motorola Atrix 4G today  and decided I d write my thoughts from a 2020 perspective   My current DD is a Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra  it s my first time back to Android since my Samsung Galaxy Note LTE  SGH i717 

Back in 2011  the phone was introduced at CES   As a burgeoning Android fan  and an AT amp T subscriber  I knew I had to have it   The ability to do whatever I wanted with Android  more on that later    the availability of all the docks  I eventually purchased the lapdock  HD Multimedia dock  and the navigation dock  

  

The specs 

Android version  at launch   Android 2 2 Froyo

Android version  final official   Android 2 3 6 Gingerbread

CPU  Nvidia Geforce 2  dual core  1GHz Cortex A9 

GPU  Nvidia Geforce ULP

Ram  1GB LPDDR2

Storage  16 GB  up to 32 GB microSD supported

Display  4 inch  960x540 qHD display  275 ppi  16M colors  Gorilla Glass 1

Rear Camera  5MP AF  digital zoom  LED flash

Front camera  0 3MP VGA

Other features  HSPA  connection  headphone jack  Webtop applications  Ubuntu based   tricolor notification LED  Fingerprint scanner  MicroUSB connection  MicroHDMI connection   

  

So onto it   First things first  nowadays  the Atrix feels almost toy like  The diminutive size compared to the S20U  plastic shell  and non laminated screen all contribute to make something that feels like a child s toy  The impression is not helped by the weight of the device  it is easily half the weight of the S20U   The screen off animation is a really neat feature that is designed to emulate an old tube television   

Android Gingerbread is a rough around the edges platform  and is nowhere near as smooth as iOS was in the era   Stuttering is a problem when swiping to a homescreen with several factory installed widgets on it   

The screen is uninspiring  the resolution is low  and brightness is terrible   The  pentile  design and low resolution combine to create a hideous display by modern standards   This can be alleviated somewhat by turning off the autobrightness control and setting brightness manually to 100    

The dialer app is hideous  with MOTOBLUR colors  but all buttons are within easy reach  something that modern phones suffer from  and manufacturers are implementing different one hand mode options to correct   

The keyboard is as basic as they come  there is no autocorrect  but even on a 4  screen  typing isn t as difficult as you think it d be   

There are no system wide gestures  or even a quick settings menu available 

The camera app is separate from the video recording app  and each has a dedicated button available to switch between the two   Each app does however  have different presets for different environmental conditions that must be manually selected   Different effects are also available for both still and video mode   

Unfortunately  this phone has AT amp T branding and apps everywhere  and suffers from the terrible MOTOBLUR system skin and software   The MOTOBLUR servers are now gone and you can no longer reactivate your MOTOBLUR account if you wipe the phone   There are instructions to bypass the activation    MOTOBLUR Bypass   Youtube  https   youtu be wXDj h1DEAM   

The built in web browser  conveniently named  Browser  is unable to access many basic sites nowadays   Some sites suffer from formatting issues   apple com  https   apple com  engadget com   and others  local news sites  fail to load at all 

The stock calendar  Text Message and Email apps all work conveniently enough  and with no random lags  but confusingly enough  there is a separate Gmail app that works with a google account  otherwise one must log in separately with the Email app   

The stock gallery app is laggy on initial startup  and again is covered in the hideous MOTOBLUR coloring   The same for the stock Music app 

Now to the main selling point of the Atrix  it wasn t the screen  it wasn t the apps  it wasn t the camera  it wasn t the performance or the UI  it was WEBTOP   For those of you who aren t familiar  Webtop is a built in version of Ubuntu Linux that runs on top of the existing Android version  on a different screen and presents a few built in apps for productivity and office work on the go   

As you dock your phone with the lapdock  the pulsing old style Motorola logo appears  and fades to a Firefox window that proclaims itself   The future of mobile computing    It s not far off  but not entirely truthful   To start with  if you re in the US  AT amp T required a separate data plan to be able to use Webtop on their cellular network   The built in apps and Webtop Ubuntu version are non upgrade able     There is no current way  nor do I think there ever was a way  to install other Linux or Android apps on stock Webtop   So  you have a lapdock  which gives you a decent but not outstanding keyboard and mouse  think Dell  not Lenovo or Apple  an extended battery  and an outdated  useless web browser   

Sadly  after a reformat I am unable to get the Market to load and let me download new apps  if any of you have a solution to that  I d be open to hearing it   

Its primary competitors at the time were the Samsung Galaxy S II  HTC Desire S  and Google Nexus S among others   

  

The Atrix line continued a while longer  exclusive to AT amp T in the US  with the release of the Atrix 2 and Atrix HD   The line was subsequently discontinued   

  

At the time  Motorola promised an Ice Cream Sandwich update  which never officially arrived   This soured myself and many other Motorola users  experiences   As it were  the Gingerbread update was overpromised and overhyped and arrived late   

  

The Atrix 4G was a decent phone  but overhyped  bloated by MOTOBLUR  and gimped by AT amp T   It was simply outclassed by the Samsung Galaxy SII and others  with better processors and better  AMOLED  screens 

Anything you d like to see or hear  let me know   I ve got a few other phones I can look at  the SGH i717 Note 1  Nokia Lumia 520  Nokia Lumia 1520  Nokia Lumia 950  amp  950XL  iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone X   For whatever reason  I don t normally throw old phones away ",Android,motorola atrix g looking back far come found old motorola atrix g today decided write thought perspective current dd samsung galaxy ultra first time back since samsung galaxy note lte sgh back introduced ce burgeoning fan subscriber knew ability whatever wanted later availability dock eventually purchased lapdock hd multimedia dock navigation dock spec version launch froyo version final official gingerbread cpu nvidia geforce dual core ghz cortex gpu nvidia geforce ulp ram gb lpddr storage gb gb microsd supported display inch x qhd display ppi color gorilla glass rear camera mp af digital zoom led flash front camera mp vga feature hspa connection headphone jack webtop application ubuntu based tricolor notification led fingerprint scanner microusb connection microhdmi connection onto first thing first nowadays atrix feel almost toy like diminutive size compared u plastic shell non laminated screen contribute make something feel like child toy impression helped weight device easily half weight u screen animation really neat feature designed emulate old tube television gingerbread rough around edge platform nowhere near smooth io era stuttering problem swiping homescreen several factory installed widget screen uninspiring resolution low brightness terrible pentile design low resolution combine create hideous display modern standard alleviated somewhat turning autobrightness control setting brightness manually dialer app hideous motoblur color button within easy reach something modern phone suffer manufacturer implementing different one hand mode option correct keyboard basic come autocorrect even screen typing difficult think system wide gesture even quick setting menu available camera app separate video recording app dedicated button available switch two app however different presets different environmental condition must manually selected different effect also available still video mode unfortunately branding apps everywhere suffers terrible motoblur system skin software motoblur server gone longer reactivate motoblur account wipe instruction bypass activation motoblur bypass youtube http youtu wxdj h deam built web browser conveniently named browser unable access many basic site nowadays site suffer formatting issue apple http apple engadget others local news site fail load stock calendar text message email apps work conveniently enough random lag confusingly enough separate gmail app work google account otherwise one must log separately email app stock gallery app laggy initial startup covered hideous motoblur coloring stock music app main selling point atrix screen apps camera performance ui webtop familiar webtop built version ubuntu linux run top existing version different screen present built apps productivity office work go dock lapdock pulsing old style motorola logo appears fade firefox window proclaims future mobile computing far entirely truthful start u required separate data plan able use webtop cellular network built apps webtop ubuntu version non upgrade able current way think ever way install linux apps stock webtop lapdock give decent outstanding keyboard mouse think dell lenovo apple extended battery outdated useless web browser sadly reformat unable get market load let download new apps solution open hearing primary competitor time samsung galaxy ii htc desire google nexus among others atrix line continued longer exclusive u release atrix atrix hd line subsequently discontinued time motorola promised ice cream sandwich update never officially arrived soured many motorola user experience gingerbread update overpromised overhyped arrived late atrix g decent overhyped bloated motoblur gimped simply outclassed samsung galaxy sii others better processor better amoled screen anything like see hear let know got phone look sgh note nokia lumia nokia lumia nokia lumia xl plus x whatever reason normally throw old phone away

   Headphone jack  Yes  I do know my Pixel 2 XL also doesn t have one  but after having it for more than two years I realised how many times I felt like missing something  Nice addition but I would accept a phone without if all criteria are met  
   Acceptable speaker sound quality  Relatively important 
   Camera that is not a downgrade from my Pixel  Important 

Given these criteria and wanting ANC Earbuds for a long time  I immediately ordered after finding a decent deal here in Germany  

After having it for one day  I unfortunately need to say  I m sending it back  Though before going for the negative  let my just summarize the positive 

  The speakers are astonishing  They literally sound like professional grade ones  are very load on max notably loader than my Pixel s  and offer continous sound quality from almost inaudible to max  To be fair  my Pixel s speakers are pretty terrible on higher volume levels  very canny and lots of overdrive   
  High refresh rate  After setting everything up  it came to my mind how incredibly smooth 120Hz feels in comparison to regular 60Hz  Also there is considerably less ghosting on low brightness levels than on my Pixel 
  Compared to my current phone  it really felt incredibly smooth and responsive  Though there was some unexpected lag during installing my apps that I did not expect for a phone having the fastest not Apple chip available right now 
  The build quality feels top notch and is notably better than Google s 

Neutral  
  The form factor  I think it just takes some time to get used to it  
  Preinstalled apps like Facebook and Netflix  Some say it s unacceptable for a phone of that price point  I don t really care to be honest 

The negative 
  Everything about the screen apart from the refresh rate and colors  I can t really describe it  but comparing it hand to hand with my Pixel it looks significantly more blurry  It s weird to describe though  it s not only the lower resolution  it looks like there is some kind of goussian blur   smoothing applied 
  The screen is significantly less bright on max brightness as well  That is a no go criteria for me  as in full sun  even my current phone is sometimes not bright enough to make everything easily legible 

  Now to the most important  The camera 

Given that Sony manufactures most of the sensors used in modern day phones and three years having passed since the release of the Pixel 2 XL  I didn t even think about the possibility of the camera being a downgrade  But unfortunately I have to say 

It is  At least if you plan to use it as a point and shoot camera and don t want to mess with manual settings on your phone  Summary of reasons 

  The front facing camera is terrible  It s  heavily smoothed to the point that it looks like a cheap blur filter is applied to the entire image  beauty mode  face smoothing was disabled  Yes  I did check twice   
The dynamic range is basically nonexistent  if you take a selfie in front of a window you have the choice between a pitch black face with an differentiable background and a visible face with a heavily overexposed background  This might sound exaggerated  but I think my old iPhone 6 has a better front facing camera  
  The image processing software  I do know that the Pixel is very good at it  but I did believe most highend manufacturers caught up  Apparently not all  While looking more natural in general  it regularily fucks up the colors  greens sometimes look blueish  sometimes yellowish  it s especially in interiors  
  The autofocus  It s embarrisangly slow  Seriously  it takes an eternity to focus on simple things  especially if the object is near to the lens  Also  in the dark the autofocus is almost unusable  After taking dozens of pictures  shooting a moving animal like a dog in a darker environment is impossible  
  At times it has pretty notable chromatic abberation and halo effects  I don t even know how this can be an issue anymore  

While the additional lenses are a significant upgrade to the single lens of the Pixel 2 XL  for my personal use cases the Sony just feels like a downgrade all in all 


Feel free to ask me any questions  I try to answer if I can but I already sent the phone back  so I might not be able to reply to some specific ones 


TLDR 

Wanted to replace my 2 1 2 y o  Pixel 2XL after being disappointed with the display and the size  Sony Xperia 5 II felt like the perfect replacement 
Sent it back because of the too dim display  on max brightness  and the lackluster camera quality  especially on the image processing side

475,"Quick thoughts on my Pixel 5  Edit  Warning that this post has rustled some jimmies  I m not sure why  but there is some serious salt about  the mid range Snapdragon 765g performing in real life as it does on paper  slightly worse than a flagship from the last few years 

I think I just crushed  r Android s dream of picking up a cheap 765 device and claiming there s no difference to the latest Galaxy or iPhone and folks are MAD 


                      

  Original Post  

I received my Pixel 5 yesterday  after debating hard over Pixel vs Samsung S20FE  Below are my thoughts for others who are as detail focused as I am 

  Performance  

Uh oh   

I was initially concerned about performance when I read this wasn t shipping with a flagship CPU  Then the marketing material and YouTube reviews assured me that I didn t  need  a flagship processor  as I don t game or edit on my phone  I have a very powerful gaming PC and editing suite for that   The 765g  should  be enough to keep things smooth 

I can unhappily report that is not the case  The performance is notably worse than my 2 year old OnePlus 6t 

  The very first thing I noticed after powering the device on is that the little  Google coloured  loading animations were struggling  I ve been through the installer countless times on multiple devices and this is the first time I ve noticed this animation not being completely smooth 
 Now confirmed by multiple users 

  It s the first time that I ve noticed slowdown during setup as apps are installing in the background  System animations stuttered until it had finished downloading and installing my apps from the Play Store  This absolutely doesn t happen on my OnePlus 6t   I ve flashed ROMs and installed these apps countless times   Now confirmed by multiple users 

  As I detail below  there are stutters on animations when using Nova or Armchair Launcher   Confirmed to be an issue with other Pixel devices 

  I have never noticed loading screens on apps for as long as I can remember before now 

  I have haptic feedback on my keyboard  and there is a tiny but noticeable lag between pressing a key and feeling the feedback which is very distracting when trying to type 

  Sync  my Reddit app  crashed and exited whilst writing this review  I m guessing a memory limitation  I ve never seen the app crash before   Confirmed to be an issue with other Pixel devices 

  If you take a portrait photo  or slow motion video  and then immediately try to view in the gallery   it ll show as  processing   https   imgur com a hbv8CYw  for about   10   5 seconds  If you take multiple photos  it s even longer  I have never noticed this before on my old Pixel  Xiaomi device or OnePlus devices and it s annoying when you re trying to show people the photo you just took of them 

 Edit  Confirmed by other owners and it s even worse for photos than I thought  It can handle 4 portraits in quick succession before the camera shutter button turns grey and stops responding until it finishes processing  My OP6t can manage 7 with Gcam on the same subject and conditions 

None of these are dealbreakers in isolation  but they add up to a underwhelming experience on a brand new device  Especially concerning as these aren t intensive tasks  these are things that people will notice throughout their day as they use their phone for normal user stuff 

More concerning  I just can t see this hardware holding up in a year or two s time as apps become more intensive  Our Xiaomi A2 was buttery smooth when we got it  but is now very slow after 2 years to the point that the moment has passed by the time the camera has opened  I can see the Pixel going the same way  This shouldn t be a concern on a  600 flagship handset  but it is 


  Software  

Vanilla Android has historically been my preference  After unpleasant experiences with OEM software from the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi recently  I lean towards Pixel in terms of software experience  I m more concerned about UX and polish than tonnes of features and in that regard  Google has always been my favourite 

As expected  setup was great and there isn t much bloat 

That said  this Pixel has unpleasantly surprised me I m a few ways which shows how Google are losing the edge here in terms of useability 

1  The gesture navigation on the Pixel sucks  The back gesture interferes with the keyboard and hamburger menus  There are workarounds  but they can t make up for a stupid back gesture being Google s choice here  It feels like Google has never actually used the phone to allow these to make it into release  I have managed to disable the left edge gesture entirely via adb to improve the situation  but it isn t good and there is no way most users will know how to do this  Sure  I could use Fluid Navigation Gestures from the Play store  but then I d lose some of the smooth animations that make the device feel modern  I shouldn t have to choose 

2  Pixel launcher is not flexible  The  at a glance  widget with weather and calender has an ugly drop Shadow on it that looks so old fashioned  and the widget can t be removed  Nor can the Google search bar at the bottom  Sure  I can switch to Nova  but then I lose the nice app closing animations of the stock launcher and I ve found Nova and Lawn chair animations actually glitch a lot when exiting some apps like camera and Chrome  presumably due to hardware performance bottlenecks 

In summary  it feels like Google have lost touch here  I m actually tempted by OneUI 


  Camera  

Seems good so far  but honestly not as much of n improvement over my OnePlus 6t as I expected  The cinematic video looks great 


  Size  

The Pixel is the only device I m aware of with a decent camera  no bezels and reasonable size 

For anyone with a separate device for media creation and video consumption  this device is a much better size than a phablet  It fits in my hand and can already feel my OP6T induced RSI subsiding  This alone is enough to keep me on this device 

  Hardware  

Looks and feels amazing  The slim  symmetrical bezels are beautiful  This is the best looking Android device I ve used  maybe even the best device altogether 

The device has a 90hz screen but in honesty I can t tell the difference versus my 60hz OP6t screen  I can spot when my PC games drop below about 110fps  so I am quite attuned to this stuff  so I m pretty confident when I say that high refresh rate screens offer diminishing returns above 60fps outside of gaming  It may be the case that the underwhelming CPU in this device just isn t managing to push 90fps in animations 

 Edit  I just compared side by side to my OP6t  and when scrolling  I can spot the difference on the 90hz screen  But it isn t a game changer like my 144hz monitor made to gaming 

The linear haptic motor feels much better than the one in my OnePlus 6t  but causes a loud rattle that sounds like it is coming from the camera module perhaps  As I enjoy haptic feedback on typing  this is actually really annoying and a huge quality issue 

  Conclusion  

If you need a new device on a budget  this is a good candidate  It s especially good if you prefer a smaller device and value aesthetics 

However if you have a flagship  even an older one  this is probably going to be a pretty disappointing upgrade  In fact it s really more of a downgrade when performance is notably not flagship level and the camera hasn t improved for a couple of generations ",Android,quick thought pixel edit warning post rustled jimmy sure serious salt mid range snapdragon g performing real life paper slightly worse flagship last year think crushed r dream picking cheap device claiming difference latest galaxy folk mad original post received pixel yesterday debating hard pixel v samsung fe thought others detail focused performance uh oh initially concerned performance read shipping flagship cpu marketing material youtube review assured need flagship processor game edit powerful gaming pc editing suite g enough keep thing smooth unhappily report case performance notably worse year old oneplus first thing noticed powering device little google coloured loading animation struggling installer countless time multiple device first time noticed animation completely smooth confirmed multiple user first time noticed slowdown setup apps installing background system animation stuttered finished downloading installing apps play store absolutely happen oneplus flashed rom installed apps countless time confirmed multiple user detail stutter animation using nova armchair launcher confirmed issue pixel device never noticed loading screen apps long remember haptic feedback keyboard tiny noticeable lag pressing key feeling feedback distracting trying type sync app crashed exited whilst writing review guessing memory limitation never seen app crash confirmed issue pixel device take portrait photo slow motion video immediately try view gallery show processing http imgur hbv cyw second take multiple photo even longer never noticed old pixel xiaomi device oneplus device annoying trying show people photo took edit confirmed owner even worse photo thought handle portrait quick succession camera shutter button turn grey stop responding finish processing op manage gcam subject condition none dealbreakers isolation add underwhelming experience brand new device especially concerning intensive task thing people notice throughout day use normal user stuff concerning see hardware holding year two time apps become intensive xiaomi buttery smooth got slow year point moment passed time camera opened see pixel going way concern flagship handset software vanilla historically preference unpleasant experience oem software like samsung xiaomi recently lean towards pixel term software experience concerned ux polish tonne feature regard google always favourite expected setup great much bloat said pixel unpleasantly surprised way show google losing edge term useability gesture navigation pixel suck back gesture interferes keyboard hamburger menu workarounds make stupid back gesture google choice feel like google never actually used allow make release managed disable left edge gesture entirely via adb improve situation good way user know sure could use fluid navigation gesture play store lose smooth animation make device feel modern choose pixel launcher flexible glance widget weather calender ugly drop shadow look old fashioned widget removed google search bar bottom sure switch nova lose nice app closing animation stock launcher found nova lawn chair animation actually glitch lot exiting apps like camera chrome presumably due hardware performance bottleneck summary feel like google lost touch actually tempted oneui camera seems good far honestly much n improvement oneplus expected cinematic video look great size pixel device aware decent camera bezel reasonable size anyone separate device medium creation video consumption device much better size phablet fit hand already feel op induced rsi subsiding alone enough keep device hardware look feel amazing slim symmetrical bezel beautiful best looking device used maybe even best device altogether device hz screen honesty tell difference versus hz op screen spot pc game drop fps quite attuned stuff pretty confident say high refresh rate screen offer diminishing return fps outside gaming may case underwhelming cpu device managing push fps animation edit compared side side op scrolling spot difference hz screen game changer like hz monitor made gaming linear haptic motor feel much better one oneplus cause loud rattle sound like coming camera module perhaps enjoy haptic feedback typing actually really annoying huge quality issue conclusion need new device budget good candidate especially good prefer smaller device value aesthetic however flagship even older one probably going pretty disappointing upgrade fact really downgrade performance notably flagship level camera improved couple generation

The reason I m most excited for this is  believe it or not  Bixby  I don t use Bixby much  but when it comes to reminders  she has a big advantage that the MS ToDo android app hasn t had yet  Cortana did  sometimes  but that s no longer an option     Smart Task dates and times  I can hold down the Bixby power button on my Note 20 Ultra and say  Remind me to do ____ at 9 30 tomorrow morning  and Bixby sets the reminder with the correct date and time automatically  MS ToDo has been lacking this for some unknown reason  But I wasn t ready to switch to Samsung Reminder because I do as much or more of my ToDo management on my PC  This is now the best of both worlds  and so far  so good

So basically when viewing content on the 10  i notice no banding when viewing content that has dark background  The FE is another story  I m not quite sure if I have a defective screen or not  The internet says OLED Banding is normal but I ve never seen it on any phone I ve owned  

I d encourage everyone here who owns an FE to watch this video on their phone  https   youtu be eIJxh9UGyak and see if their FE has the same issues  

The banding on the FE is apparent when viewing a lot of apps with a dark theme and it s hard to overlook

524," Opinion  Android and phone manufactures are shooting themselves in the foot  I think it is obvious from threads like this  1 5  that customers are not happy  In the top 25 posts in  r Android  a quarter of the posts are complaining about prices 

I ve personally felt immense frustration at seeing the direction of Google  Android  and other phone manufacturers  I won t make this a rant though  since I know a lot of people either already feel this way or are tired about reading this  Instead  I want to use this post to have a discussion about what we as a community  customers   reviewers  can do 

First  I want to identify a couple issues  

Smartphone prices are high  But I completely understand that it is a product of companies pushing the limits  The amount of storage   screen size   battery   camera lens that manufacturers pack into a tiny metal slab is INSANE  And I sincerely appreciate the progress and if that is what it costs to make a phone  so be it 

However  Android phone manufacturers are not just raising prices to meet their specification costs  Manufacturers are increasing prices to cover for a needless cycle of innovation without providing real utility to customers  The trend toward non removable batteries  slimmer phones  the lack of a headphone jack  lack of expandable storage  lack of quality loud speakers   vibration motors are troubling signs  

Having a phone that is useful for alarms   calls   music   entertainment is in my humble opinion more important than having a phone that charges fast  has wireless charging  is water resistant  is slim   good looking etc  I m not saying that manufacturers shouldn t add these features  they are extremely valuable to some users  But the thesis of my argument is that Android phone manufacturers are foregoing fundamentals for the sake of  premium  features  Premium features are only good if they are built on a solid foundation  

Moreover  Android as an operating system has gotten less and less customizable  It has been supremely nerfed compared to days of the past  And useful features like  intent  and  share  have not received the love and care that is required to make them more integral to the operating system  Instead  cosmetic changes like notification grouping  chat heads etc are being brought in to new Android versions that again don t address fundamental issues  Design decisions like having the pill constantly at the bottom of the screen boggle my mind 

This is what personally drove me to write all this  If I wanted the lack of a headphone jack  the lack of expandable storage  the lack of customization  I would just use iOS and Apple phones  

What can Android do better 

  Better share features
  Integrate  intent  customization so apps can interact with each other
  Allow more customization
  Look to the rooting community
  Make a better platform for power users

What can Android phone manufacturers do better 

  Commit to software updates
  Release fewer phones each year
  Pack more basic features into phone  One flagship with everything is better than 10 sort of flagship phones missing a bunch of features 

What can reviewers do better 

  Call manufacturers out more
  Do long term reviews  I m still using a Pixel from more than 4 years ago  The average customer does not upgrade their phone every 6 months   every year  I would like to know what phone from last year still holds up  If more reviewers did this  more manufacturers would be incentivized to support their phones longer 

What can customers do better 

  Don t buy phones often 
  Be environmentally conscious
  Be cost sensitive
  Support companies that are doing right by the customer  my personal opinion is that Sony is probably the only company that I would say is  doing the right thing  
  Be okay with compromises that support the previous points 

Personally  I m trying to use my Pixel OG as long as I can  The battery barely lasts a few hours these days  so I was looking to buy a new phone and I was just so disappointed with the current market that I felt I had to write something about it  I m also seriously considering moving to an iPhone  since if I am anyway going to have to get a phone without a headphone jack or expandable storage  I might as well jump ship  The Sony Xperia 5 II  Sony Xperia 1 II are the only phones appealing at the moment to me  

What do you all think  Am I overreacting to the market  Surely this price craziness cannot last  right

533,"Re  Would you prefer if phones were thicker  Yesterday there was a post  Would you prefer if phones were thicker   https   www reddit com r Android comments j8k7xt would_you_prefer_if_phones_were_thicker   A lot of people stated that they would prefer a thicker phone  I think I have the phone for you 

A month ago my Galaxy S20 s antenna broke somehow due to getting it wet in the rain  I went deep into the dumbphone world as I didn t use most of the features a smartphone provided  I ordered a  LightPhone II  https   www thelightphone com    a Chinese phone the  Xiaomi QIN 1s   https   www gearbest com featured phones pp_009404486600 html   and finally the phone in which inspired this post the  Unihertz Atom L  https   www unihertz com   

Unihertz is a Chinese company that has some really interesting projects  The Unihertz Jelly is a super small Android device of which might be too small for my use  Its cousin is the Unihertz Atom which is marketed as the world s smartest rugged phone  Again too small for my use  Fortunately  the Atom comes in a  larger  size in the Atom XL and Atom L  Both of which are the same phone  the former just has a DMR Walkie Talkie  And since I have no need for a walkie talkie I purchased the Atom L 

Here are some specs 

  4 0 inch screen
  Non removable 4300mAh battery
  NFC
  Headphone Jack
  Reprogrammable buttons
  Very waterproof
  Micro SD
  Fingerprint  amp  Face Unlock
  USB C
  48 MP Rear Camera
  Global Unlocked
  Dual SIM Card

This phone is great  It s definitely thick  Due to it being so big there is no camera bump  And because it s a cheap rugged phone  I doubt you ll need to put a case on it  With typical daily use  the phone typically gets charged at the end of the day with 50  battery left  I ve even had the phone last 4 days with light use 

Sorry if this is a shill  I just really think this is a great phone that many people don t know about  Due to the post yesterday getting a ton of interest I thought you all might find this phone interesting  I wish companies would head in a similar direction  

Maybe smaller phones will be the next trend  I sure do hope so ",Android,would prefer phone thicker yesterday post would prefer phone thicker http r comment j k xt would prefer phone thicker lot people stated would prefer thicker think month ago galaxy antenna broke somehow due getting wet rain went deep dumbphone world use feature smartphone provided ordered lightphone ii http thelightphone chinese xiaomi qin http gearbest featured phone pp html finally inspired post unihertz atom l http unihertz unihertz chinese company really interesting project unihertz jelly super small device might small use cousin unihertz atom marketed world smartest rugged small use fortunately atom come larger size atom xl atom l former dmr walkie talkie since need walkie talkie purchased atom l spec inch screen non removable mah battery nfc headphone jack reprogrammable button waterproof micro sd fingerprint face unlock usb c mp rear camera global unlocked dual sim card great definitely thick due big camera bump cheap rugged doubt need put case typical daily use typically get charged end day battery left even last day light use sorry shill really think great many people know due post yesterday getting ton interest thought might find interesting wish company would head similar direction maybe smaller phone next trend sure hope
534,"S20 FE 5G   Dissapointed somehow    I have been using S20 FE now since October 5th and my initial thoughts   Wow phone is super fast as compared to my existing Note 8 which I was planning to trade in  Everything worked better than note 8   Smooth scrolling thanks to 120 Hz display  quick fingerprint sensor and punch  hole camera  my first experience  looks stunning  BUT the problem started when I was using camera on FE outdoors and took my note 8 with me so that I could compare 

First screen on FE is not as bright as Note 8 and adaptive brightness didn t work as expected causing screen not switching to full brightness even though slider was showing max brightness level  I had to turn off adaptive brightness option and reset the slider again to gain full brightness  Also FE was running very hot compared to Note 8 and when I did some research I found some Galaxy phones have this issue so I reset the phone and followed some other troubleshooting stuff  But the issue came back next day and I am so frustrated with this issue when I like everything else on FE but just cant digest my 2017 note 8 screen is better than 2020 phone 

Secondly colors looked washed up on FE I mean screen is in VIVID setting on FE and its just no match with Note 8 where screen looks fantastic   I like saturated vivid screens   I took a picture of hibiscus in my front yard and when I looked on FE screen it looked so whitish and pink color was not as punchy as it looked in Note 8  Definitely on FE screen is sub par and for me that is a deal breaker and leaning towards Note 20 ultra now ",Android,fe g dissapointed somehow using fe since october th initial thought wow super fast compared existing note planning trade everything worked better note smooth scrolling thanks hz display quick fingerprint sensor punch hole camera first experience look stunning problem started using camera fe outdoors took note could compare first screen fe bright note adaptive brightness work expected causing screen switching full brightness even though slider showing max brightness level turn adaptive brightness option reset slider gain full brightness also fe running hot compared note research found galaxy phone issue reset followed troubleshooting stuff issue came back next day frustrated issue like everything else fe cant digest note screen better secondly color looked washed fe mean screen vivid setting fe match note screen look fantastic like saturated vivid screen took picture hibiscus front yard looked fe screen looked whitish pink color punchy looked note definitely fe screen sub par deal breaker leaning towards note ultra
535,"i know this can never be possible in this consumer centric market but phones should adopt the videogame consoles release model releasing a phone ever year is completely unnecessary and a big waste  ideally phones should be like the PlayStation where one model gets released every few years  

the thing is  people rarely buy a new phone every year anyway  the average buyer keeps it for at least a couple  

the way it works is that this year the majority of people who will buy a new phone will be the ones who have last bought one 2 or 3 years ago  next year will be people who bought it 1 or 2 years ago and so on 

if you make so that new phones get released every 2 or 3 years you would basically have in total the same ammount of sells  yes it would be less but there would also be much less cost on manufacturing  


the only real downside to this model is that YouTube phone reviewer will lose their job because there would be much less stuff to review ",Android,know never possible consumer centric market phone adopt videogame console release model releasing ever year completely unnecessary big waste ideally phone like playstation one model get released every year thing people rarely buy new every year anyway average buyer keep least couple way work year majority people buy new one last bought one year ago next year people bought year ago make new phone get released every year would basically total ammount sell yes would le would also much le cost manufacturing real downside model youtube reviewer lose job would much le stuff review

Other specs of the phone are very much acceptable for 2020  I especially love how the phone looks with it being the first Android phone to come with symmetrical bezels  The compact size is amazing too  Sorta Sage looks like a brilliant colour too imo  So many things to absolutely love about this phone

551,"S20 FE  things I didn t hear beforehand Hi all  Have had my S20 FE for a few days now and wanted to share some thoughts I haven t seen posted online anywhere that I think might help some prospective buyers 

1  Because of the optical fingerprint sensor  the blue light filter does not work on the lock screen  Ordinarily  this isn t a huge issue  but when navigating with Google Maps at night the blue can be jarring if you re not used to it 
2  My own device seemingly has display response issues  I ve seen some accounts of people noticing the phone tapping and swiping even without their input  but I m not referring to this  Sometimes I have to tap or swipe multiple times before the phone registers my action  even when there is no other task going on at the same time 
3  May be related to the last issue for me  and might be an actual hardware problem  but my fingerprint reader is very hit or miss  When it works it works decently most of the time  However  every once in a while it seems to go haywire and not register my fingerprint at all and causes me to have to wait to re enter 
4  Coming from an S8   the screen is significantly less bright at its max setting  especially with the extra outdoor brightness the S8  would turn on with Adaptive Brightness 
5  Again  coming from an S8   I find there to be a fair amount of off axis color shifting on the display 
6  Have never really cared too much about the vibration haptic motor  but this one is pretty weak and feels relatively much more low quality than any other piece of the phone for me 

Overall a decent phone  but quite a few pieces that have added up to make the phone less of a quality experience than I was expecting  I haven t seen mention of any of these issues anywhere else  so may  be an issue with my own device  Any feedback would be welcome  Thanks  and let me know if you have any questions ",Android,fe thing hear beforehand hi fe day wanted share thought seen posted online anywhere think might help prospective buyer optical fingerprint sensor blue light filter work lock screen ordinarily huge issue navigating google map night blue jarring used device seemingly display response issue seen account people noticing tapping swiping even without input referring sometimes tap swipe multiple time register action even task going time may related last issue might actual hardware problem fingerprint reader hit miss work work decently time however every seems go haywire register fingerprint cause wait enter coming screen significantly le bright max setting especially extra outdoor brightness would turn adaptive brightness coming find fair amount axis color shifting display never really cared much vibration haptic motor one pretty weak feel relatively much low quality piece overall decent quite piece added make le quality experience expecting seen mention issue anywhere else may issue device feedback would welcome thanks let know question

571,"Which phone has a great camera  if you know how to use it   I dusted off my old LG G4 recently and decided to play with its camera a bit  I am still amazed by how good G4 s interface is   Manual controls are excellent   https   i cdn phonearena com images articles 199214 image lg g4 manual camera mode jpg  And give you control over pretty much anything you would need  There is no HDR or any unnatural processing on the phone  I love that it lets you pick white balance  I like to make images a bit warmer looking  And what s amazing is that all of these changes are real time so you can see what you are changing exactly 

It does not have any intelligent bracketing or AI tricks  with night shots and long exposure you will need a tripod  The sensor is very good though and with full manual controls  if you know how to use them  you will get an output of very nice  pleasant images that will easily rival and even beat modern smartphones 

I compared it to my Pixel and while Pixel tries to get the most mathematically correct images and tries to destroy shadows and bring light where it s not supposed to be  even at the expense of lots of noise and grain  LG G4 clips highlights  crashes shadows  but produces more  photographic  images 

If you give to a person who has no clue how to use it and does not put in the effort  Pixel will absolutely  autoperform  it  But otherwise  LG G4 will easily give modern smartphones a run for their money 

What other cameraphones do you know or have that fit the category of  if you know how to use it  it s amazing

626,"Living With A Chinese Phone Flagship Killer in The West I recently purchased a Vivo IQOO Neo 3  and accidentally an additional Iqoo 3   After purchasing them  I had soon found out about the Iqoo 5  But it was too late  I couldn t cancel    and the phones were shipped  I had to wait nearly 2 3 months for both phones to arrive  It s a great phone    but there were a lot of things left out of reviews for these Chinese phones that all these reviewers and YouTubers leave out 

Sure  they briefly mention  that you ll most likely need to install Google Services and what not    But they don t tell you the deeper story about actually using it in the west 

Now I can t say the experience is like this with every Chinese phone    but I can imagine it would be similar to a degree 

You see  my Vivo Iqoo Neo 3 is LOADED with Chinese software  Half or so of which I was able to uninstall  The other half being system related things  No problem then right  WRONG  Nearly everything you do will end up running through Vivo s app store or loader  You may even get occasional ads to install suggested apps  It didn t seem that egregious at first    until you start trying to open tabs or save contacts to their terrible software 

Luckily you can disable most of their system apps and replace it with your preferred  In my case I went with as much Google apps as possible  But    there s still an issue  Some of these apps cannot seem to be saved as the default system app while some can  This results in a weird mish mash of cross apps  If that makes sense  For example  I ve set my phone  contacts  message  GPS and store to Google  However  in the system settings  you can only change GPS and messages as your default app  The phone dialler  luckily  prompts you if you want to install it as the default app  Contacts on the other hand    no luck with that  As such  if I try to save a new contact in Google Messages it will launch the stock Vivo contacts  Which  again  may not be that big of a deal    but as someone who is particular about how to save and name their contacts   this is a big issue for me 

The problem persists when you get sent links  The problem sometimes persists when an app tries to launch another app  Sometimes it works    sometimes it tries to force you to load a Vivo LAUNCHER that brings you to their Vivo Store  Fuck  That  Shit 

It s been two weeks living with a China phone  Some of the notifications are extremely wonky  I haven t used an Android ever since the HTC One roughly 8 years or so ago  Sometimes the notification ringer is set off    but no notifications  An icon on top appears but there s never a banner  Not even on the lock screen    EVEN IF the settings are all on 

There s still a few things I m trying to learn or find a way to get around  such as the saving contacts thing   In the mean time I have to do everything that annoys me MANUALLY when in 2020 it should  just work   But it doesn t    and that appears to be the true sacrifice with going these cheaper Chinese phones Flagship killers 

My friend  after my suggestion  bought a Xiaomi MiPad 4 Plus and faced similar issues  Luckily for him he uses it strictly for gaming and Youtube so the issues became non existent for him after a few days 

So  would I recommend you or anyone else to use one of these Chinese phones  Honestly    probably not  Especially not with Samsung s new S20 Fan Edition  But if you truly had the time to tinker with every little setting to get it just the way you want it    and if you can live with all these nuances and inconveniences    then honestly it s actually a great phone 

 amp  x200B 

edit  Outside of these nuances  as briefly mentioned  it s a great phone  I live in a major Canadian city so I m still getting full LTE speeds  no dropped calls  all my SMS MMS are sending fine  the pictures are decent  I am or used to be a huge Nokia fan so nothing really impresses me   I own a Canon 6D DSLR as well anyway   the UI is actually decent  it has 2 styles to choose from   the LCD is surprisingly nice  previous  phone was an iPhone X  and it s blazingly fast  It even has a headphone port  Speakers are decent as well with it s supposedly HiFi DAC  I have a dedicated DAP so I don t use this feature

655,"WearOS vs Tizen comparison for Android users I recently bought a TicWatch Pro 3 and quite frankly  this has exceeded expectations and marks a huge change for wearables  I ve owned several smartwatches with different OS s  including Samsung and previous WearOS watches  and thought I d share my experience with how well this works with Android  and why I think this is a game changer 

My previous WearOS watch was a Fossil Sport Gen 4 and my Samsung watch is a Galaxy Watch Active 2  The low RAM and poor CPU made the Fossil almost redundant  It was almost always quicker to get my phone out than to grind through the watch  which made it basically redundant  Well I can happily say  not any more  this TicWatch with the new 4100 CPU and 1gb of RAM is smooth and WearOS becomes useful  Read on for more 

  Notifications

Nothing compares to WearOS here  The notifications match what s on your phone and they do it well 

The most common thing I want to do with notifications is acknowledge and dismiss them  There is no quick way to do this in Tizen   it takes 2  touches  and a scroll from the alert screen  You can dismiss all notifications from a single app quite quickly with a sqipe  but usually I don t want to dismiss  all  my notifications in one go so that s basically redundant  On WearOS it is a single swipe just as it is on your phone 

Canned responses actually work  whereas on Tizen  it d jumble your chosen responses in with a load of random suggestions  even if I told it not to 

Writing my own responses is actually possible and surprisingly easy on WearOS s swipe keyboard  Not so on Tizen 

On the whole WearOS destroys Tizen here for useability  and it isn t even close 

  Winner  Ticwatch  

  Smoothness

Both are pretty even here  I d say WearOS has more well designed watch faces  but Tizen has more animated watch faces  I think that ll change now WearOS has a decent processor  Neither are as smooth as an Apple watch  but that thing can t even make it through 24 hours on a single charge  so if you want sleep tracking it s not really an option 

  Winner  Tie  

  Sports Tracking

Both very similar here  Samsung Health has more options than Goole Fit Tic Health  but I wouldn t necessarily say it is better  I don t like that Samsung Health is full of ads  so maybe that gives the edge to WearOS 

Ultimately  you re likely to put your own fitness tracking apps on either  and in that regard WearOS seems to have more options  Also  the Strava Sync actually works properly on WearOS  whereas its integration with Samsung Health is    questionable  It also logs your activities in Samsung Health twice  once via Health directly  and once in Health again after it has been sync d with Strava   Samsung s software leaves a lot ot be desired and this is typical of their glossy UI  but poor implementation 

  Winner  WearOS  

  Health Tracking

The watches are similar here 

Ticwatch seems to get my pulse much more quickly and reliably and also does blood oxygen 

Samsung Watch Active 2 allegedly will do ECG and Blood pressure  but after a year  neither have made it out of Singapore  which really irritated me  So for now  unless you re in Singapore  TicWatch has more sensors and better ability to sync across more apps 

  Winner  Ticwatch  

  Music

Samsung has official Spotify  although the UI is flakey  and Tidal with offline support  but WearOS has Play Music offline until the service is retired  It also unofficially has Spotify offline support with an app  Neither have Youtube Music which is my preferred service  so both are losers in that regard 

This pushed me to revert to classic MP3 transfer  The Samsung watch made this miserable   I had to sync every MP3 one by one  no playlist support  or tell it to sync automatically  which would sync  everything  on the phone  including podcasts  audiobooks and my white noise  It filled my watch s memory up every time I downloaded a white noise track and was infuriating and there was no way to exclude folders 

On WearOS  there are multiple ways to get MP3s onto the watch 

  Winner  WearOS   

  Payments

Both watches support mobile payments  Samsung Pay supported very few banks  and didn t support my main bank 

Samsung s watch also requires you to long press to wake the pay app  and then put in a fiddly pin code every time 

WearOS supports all of my banks  the tap and pay launches with one button press and it seems to be way more reliable 

  Winner  WearOS  

  Sleep Tracking

Samsung Health s sleep tracking is notoriously poor  I had two Watch Active 2 s  and both tracked so little  deep sleep  that I d probably be dead if it was correct  I tried the Sleep as Android app  but found it unreliable and the UI poor 

The Tic Sleep app on my Ticwatch is absolutely fantastic and matches my Mi Band 

  Winner  WearOS  

  Voice Assistant

Bixby is a joke   nothing integrates with it unless you have a physical SmartThings Hub  I believe even Samsung are dropping it 

Google Asistant works with Google Home right off the bat  with no hardware required  It is also way better at answering questions  Google Assistant also launches more quickly 

However  the  OK Google  listening seems to be broken across all wear devices  and the assistant itself has some missing UI elements  On the whole  it wins  but it could be better 

  Winner  WearOS  

  Battery

I m getting almost 3 days from both watches with always on display and all features activated  The Ticwatch has an additional LCD screen which I don t like the aesthetics of  but I believe this would take me well over 3 days if I could stand to look at it 

  Winner  Tie  

  Design

This is subjective  but for me  the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best looking smartwatch bar none  It looks basically like an Apple watch  but round  which I prefer   The build quality is amazing and its minimal design lets you dictate the look from your chose watch face  

Samsung also has a fantastic native watch face creator which is easy to use and doesn t require you to have adware ridden battery hogs like Facer installed 

The Ticwatch looks more like a regular Galaxy Watch  which is modelled on traditional watches  It isn t bad  but I d rather have something less polarising as the physical design of the watch kinda dictates what faces will  work   and the bezels feel huge  I really wish the bezel didn t have numbers on it as I prefer my watch faces without numbers 

  Winner  Samsung  

So there you have it  I think with the Qualcomm 4100    CPUs  WearOS has suddenly become viable  and the Galaxy Watch series has been knocked off the top spot as  best wearable for Android users   In every category that make up my criteria  the Ticwatch matches or supasses the Samsung counterpart 

When more models are release on 4100 and consumers start picking these up  I think we ll see rapid dev interest and improvements to the platform ",Android,wearos v tizen comparison user recently bought ticwatch pro quite frankly exceeded expectation mark huge change wearable owned several smartwatches different o including samsung previous wearos watch thought share experience well work think game changer previous wearos watch fossil sport gen samsung watch galaxy watch active low ram poor cpu made fossil almost redundant almost always quicker get grind watch made basically redundant well happily say ticwatch new cpu gb ram smooth wearos becomes useful read notification nothing compare wearos notification match well common thing want notification acknowledge dismiss quick way tizen take touch scroll alert screen dismiss notification single app quite quickly sqipe usually want dismiss notification one go basically redundant wearos single swipe canned response actually work whereas tizen jumble chosen response load random suggestion even told writing response actually possible surprisingly easy wearos swipe keyboard tizen whole wearos destroys tizen useability even close winner ticwatch smoothness pretty even say wearos well designed watch face tizen animated watch face think change wearos decent processor neither smooth apple watch thing even make hour single charge want sleep tracking really option winner tie sport tracking similar samsung health option goole fit tic health necessarily say better like samsung health full ad maybe give edge wearos ultimately likely put fitness tracking apps either regard wearos seems option also strava sync actually work properly wearos whereas integration samsung health questionable also log activity samsung health twice via health directly health sync strava samsung software leaf lot ot desired typical glossy ui poor implementation winner wearos health tracking watch similar ticwatch seems get pulse much quickly reliably also blood oxygen samsung watch active allegedly ecg blood pressure year neither made singapore really irritated unless singapore ticwatch sensor better ability sync across apps winner ticwatch music samsung official spotify although ui flakey tidal offline support wearos play music offline service retired also unofficially spotify offline support app neither youtube music preferred service loser regard pushed revert classic mp transfer samsung watch made miserable sync every mp one one playlist support tell sync automatically would sync everything including podcasts audiobooks white noise filled watch memory every time downloaded white noise track infuriating way exclude folder wearos multiple way get mp onto watch winner wearos payment watch support mobile payment samsung pay supported bank support main bank samsung watch also requires long press wake pay app put fiddly pin code every time wearos support bank tap pay launch one button press seems way reliable winner wearos sleep tracking samsung health sleep tracking notoriously poor two watch active tracked little deep sleep probably dead correct tried sleep app found unreliable ui poor tic sleep app ticwatch absolutely fantastic match mi band winner wearos voice assistant bixby joke nothing integrates unless physical smartthings hub believe even samsung dropping google asistant work google home right bat hardware required also way better answering question google assistant also launch quickly however ok google listening seems broken across wear device assistant missing ui element whole win could better winner wearos battery getting almost day watch always display feature activated ticwatch additional lcd screen like aesthetic believe would take well day could stand look winner tie design subjective galaxy watch active best looking smartwatch bar none look basically like apple watch round prefer build quality amazing minimal design let dictate look chose watch face samsung also fantastic native watch face creator easy use require adware ridden battery hog like facer installed ticwatch look like regular galaxy watch modelled traditional watch bad rather something le polarising physical design watch kinda dictate face work bezel feel huge really wish bezel number prefer watch face without number winner samsung think qualcomm cpu wearos suddenly become viable galaxy watch series knocked top spot best wearable user every category make criterion ticwatch match supasses samsung counterpart model release consumer start picking think see rapid dev interest improvement platform

689,"The Pixel 5 may not be perfect  but can we take a moment to appreciate its symmetric bezel design  I didn t see anyone talking about the bezels on the Pixel 5 and how it doesn t have a forehead chin  so I thought I d make a post  Here s a  picture  https   i imgur com oGxwydE jpg  of the phone  as the promotional material didn t show pictures of it   

 amp  x200B 

The biggest thing here is how the bezels are evenly spaced on all sides  

 amp  x200B 

 It really makes the phone look great  which is not surprising considering humans are naturally drawn to symmetry      1     https   www bbc co uk bbcthree article 6adaed45 2f21 4a7b 942a 5c40a7181dd6    text According 20to 20the 20American 20scientist of 20the 20world 20around 20us 22      2     https   science howstuffworks com why do get so much pleasure from symmetry htm   even so far as finding symmetrical faces more attractive      3     https   www psychologytoday com us blog beastly behavior 201907 why are symmetrical faces so attractive    It s also a significant departure from earlier pixels  which imo looked quite fugly with those massive bezels on the top  the bottom  or even both  like the older pixels   

What s surprising is that it isn t impossible for other manufacturers to make small bezels  Samsung managed to make the Note 10 bezel smaller than the iPhone XS   comparison image  https   imgur com a fUOXqML    reddit discussion link  https   www reddit com r Android comments co0yy7 the_note_10_have_a_smaller_chin_than_the_iphone_xs     yet not a single phone has had symmetric bezels   they reduce the sides and top  making it look unproportioned  No one   not Samsung LG  which manufacture most OLED screens  not Motorola  not Xiaomi  not OnePlus Oppo Vivo  NONE of the other companies copying the  bezel less  look got this right  It was Google  the   world renowned phone company   a company making phones for funsies who actually did this correctly 

 amp  x200B 

It is interesting to observe that there clearly is some attention to detail in the Pixel phones  Google bothered to make the bezels evenly sized  and similarly their phone cases are made from over 70 percent recycled plastic  Think of how many companies actually  or even claim to  do anything for the environment  Only Apple  and Fairphone  use recycled aluminium build replaceable phones respectively 

 amp  x200B 

 Some people might find the cutout camera not great  and I agree it s not ideal but tbh moving cameras will eventually wear out  and underscreen cameras have poor performance  alongside being a slightly creepy concept

691,"Ok hear me out   Pixel 5 Pro I m pretty sure I m not the only one who s thinking it and it s painfully obvious for Google not to do this 

With the Pixel 4a  Google has created a mid range device that does all that s necessary and simple in a phone  A smart buy 

With the Pixel 5  Google created an upper mid range to flagship device with a little bit of compromise in innovation  Soli radar  and processor

What if Google takes a bite out of Apple s book and offer a

Pixel 5 Pro by May  Google s I O period if life comes back

to normal  and market it as the Pixel 5 but with the missing features like  Face ID   Motion Sense with Soli  and with more features   a bigger battery  Snapdragon 865   or whatever is new   a telephoto lens  and some other thing  can t quite remember  A Pixel 5 Pro could be marketed at  1 000  or less   It might

not sell hot cakes but it would be Google s first phone with

no compromise in any way  Pixel 5 is very close to this  and

would really fully make Google s hardware efforts have a

meaningful strategy

a  Mid range   a series  b  Lower flagship series c  Pro or Plus  series   totally skipping the XL 

It s a strategy Apple is using and Google would be dumb not to use it  Just my opinion ",Android,ok hear pixel pro pretty sure one thinking painfully obvious google pixel google created mid range device necessary simple smart buy pixel google created upper mid range flagship device little bit compromise innovation solo radar processor google take bite apple book offer pixel pro may google period life come back normal market pixel missing feature like face id motion sense solo feature bigger battery snapdragon whatever new telephoto lens thing quite remember pixel pro could marketed le might sell hot cake would google first compromise way pixel close would really fully make google hardware effort meaningful strategy mid range series b lower flagship series c pro plus series totally skipping xl strategy apple using google would dumb use opinion

693,"Galaxy A51 5G   my review after owning it for about a month I got this phone about one month ago from Best Buy for  250 unlocked  instead of  500  and it s been pretty great  I was originally going for the regular A51  but it would ve also cost  250  so I got the A51 5G instead  I can t use 5G yet  but I have used the rest of the phone  Here is my experience 

  Design    It looks and feels really nice  The back is plastic  which I actually prefer over glass  mainly because durability  I don t have a case on the phone because I feel more confident with the plastic back  Of course  if the phone was  1000 and had a plastic back  I d wouldn t be too happy  I really like the pattern on the back  and it has this cool rainbow effect depending on how the light hits it  The sides are metal  and it has that cold feeling when you pick the phone up after not using it for a while  which was something I missed from my old HTC One M8  Overall  it looks and feels more premium than it is 

  Display    Probably the best part of this phone for me  I was used to a 720p display on my Moto G7 Power  and I thought that display was great  The A51 5G s display makes the G7 Power s display look terrible  It s 1080p  so it isn t the highest resolution  but it s definitely better than 720p  It is only 60hz  I do wish it was maybe 90hz or higher  but I wouldn t expect that from a phone like this  The only reason I want a higher refresh rate is because my monitors are 144hz and I m spoiled by them  Either way  it s super crisp and clear and the colors are insanely good  Also  the bezels are basically non existent and the centered hole punch is really easy to forget about  It s probably the best display I ve ever had on a phone 

  Performance    It s great  It s way faster than the Moto G7 Power  It is not a Snapdragon though  It has an Exynos processor  I haven t noticed any issues with it  If we want to talk about benchmark scores  it seems to be between a Snapdragon 845 and 855  Single core is closer to a Snapdragon Galaxy S10 and multi core is closer to a Snapdragon Galaxy S9  I wouldn t consider myself a power user  as most of my time on my phone is spent watching YouTube  texting  or just browsing the web  but I can still feel the difference between this and my Moto G7 Power  Having 6GB of RAM instead of the 3GB on the G7 Power is a huge upgrade for me  When I am using multiple apps  they never close on me  On the G7 Power  I could only use 2 apps at once basically 

  Storage    The G7 Power had 32GB of storage  which I would say is still enough for me because it does have a microSD card slot which I use for my music collection  The A51 5G has 128GB while also having a microSD card slot  As of right now  I have only used up 34 7GB out of the 128GB  Again  my music collection is on my microSD card  and I use Google Photos to back up my pictures and videos to the cloud  so storage isn t the biggest deal for me  However  having 128GB gives me peace of mind because I know that no matter how hard I try  I will never be able to fill it up 

  Battery    This is one problem I have with the phone  It s not a huge problem  it does last through a day with moderate usage  or 2 days with lighter usage  The problem is that the battery seems to drain in sleep mode  It sheds over 10  overnight  and I have the always on display turned off  However  it does charge pretty quick  so that s a plus  It was definitely frustrating at first  especially coming from the Moto G7 Power  but over time I got used to it  No wireless charging  which isn t a big deal because I don t have wireless chargers 

  Camera    It has 4 of them  Well  3 usable cameras and a depth sensor  Nothing really to complain about  They work fine  pictures and videos look great  I m not someone who takes a ton of pictures  but having an ultrawide camera has been useful sometimes  The macro lens is pretty pointless  That s really all I can say  I guess if you re someone who takes a ton of photos  this camera is fine  Probably could be better with gcam  but I don t care enough to install it 

  Misc    It has NFC  which my Moto G7 Power did not  I think it might have MST also  because if I turn off NFC in settings  it still lets me use Samsung Pay and tells me to hold the phone up to the reader  although that could mean nothing  I haven t had the opportunity to test that out in a store  The fingerprint reader is very good for being under the display  It s optical  not ultrasonic  I d say it probably has around a 95  success rate  It also has face unlock  which works in complete darkness somehow  It only has one bottom speaker  and it s pretty okay  It s not super loud  but it gets the job done  I really wish it had dual speakers  or at least one front facing speaker  like the Moto G7 Power  However  it does have a headphone jack  which I would say is pretty important to me  Even though I do have wireless earbuds  I still prefer using my wired earbuds  Samsung s One UI is great  It is very well designed and is probably the best looking version of Android  even better looking than the stock Pixel experience  However  I have noticed ads in apps like Samsung Pay and Samsung Weather  They aren t obtrusive  though  The Galaxy Store has tried to push notification ads to me  but I just turned off notifications for it  I wish I could uninstall all the Samsung apps that are preloaded  Apps like AR Zone  Bixby  Samsung Calendar  Galaxy Store  Game Launcher  Samsung Internet  Samsung Messages  My Files  Reminder  and Samsung Tips  I mostly just use Google apps like Gmail  Chrome  Calendar  and Messages or third party apps like Solid Explorer for file management  It also came with Facebook  Spotify  and Netflix  which I was able to uninstall  Samsung has promised 3 years of updates for this phone as well  Probably not very fast  but at least it will be getting updated  I don t think it will take as long as the Moto G7 Power takes to receive updates  I just got the Android 10 update for the G7 Power 2 weeks ago  and that s probably the only major update it will get  The A51 5G will get Android 11  12  and probably 13  This is good  because I plan on keeping this phone as long as possible  I just received the September security patch as well 

  Overall    I d give this phone a 9 10  It s pretty much the best phone I could ve bought for  250  and I think I like it more than any other phone I ve had  ever  I don t know if it is worth the regular  500  but if you can find a deal  I d say go for it 

Who else here has the A51 5G  or even the regular A51  I d love to hear your thoughts

709,"Managing files in the  Android data  folder on Android 11  without root or USB  As you may be aware  Android 11 made some big changes to the Scoped Storage functionality that Google began to implement with Android 10   One of the biggest user facing changes is removing access to the  Android data  folder  blocking all apps  including file managers  from accessing any data within it 

This is unfortunate  as many apps  including emulators as well as source ports of PC games  require users to place files inside the  Android data  folder in order for these apps to run   Having access to  Android data  is also useful for backup   restore purposes   It s significantly more complicated to do so under Android 11  but there are still ways to manage files inside this folder 

One method is to connect your device up to a computer the USB and manage the files there   When connected to USB you have full access to the contents of the  Android data  folder   However  this is cumbersome and not everyone has access to a computer these days   Of course  you can root and just browse to the files via   data media 0 Android data  instead  but rooting has its own set of drawbacks 

Thankfully  there _is_ a way to fully manage files inside of the  Android data  folder  completely on device  without root or USB 

    Opening the AOSP Files app

Only _one_ app is specifically granted access by the Android platform to manage files inside the  Android data  folder   the AOSP Files app   This used to be easily accessible via a launcher icon in your app drawer  but on Pixel devices at least  that icon is gone in favor of the preloaded Files by Google app   However  it s still present on the device and it can still be launched 

  Option 1     Open up the system Settings  then navigate to Storage and click  Files 

  Option 2     Download  this Files app  https   play google com store apps details id com marc files  from the Play Store  which is really just a shortcut to open the AOSP files app 

    Copying and moving files _outside_ of the folder

Okay  so we have the AOSP files app open   Copying or moving data out of the  Android data  folder is  thankfully  pretty simple   Simply navigate to the folder as usual  long press on the content you want to select  then go to the three dot menu in the upper right and choose either  Copy to     or  Move to       This will open up a separate screen where you can navigate to the destination directory easily   Use the hamburger menu in the top left corner  then select your device s name to show your device s file system  if needed 

    Copying and moving files _into_ the folder

Getting content into the folder is a bit trickier  but still possible   If you follow the same steps above  you ll notice that when selecting the  Android  directory   data  is completely missing   What an unfortunate oversight on Google s part 

Thankfully  you can also drag and drop files into the folder from the main file manager view  which works fine   So  in order to get content _into_ the  Android data  folder 

1  First  copy or move your files into the top level of your device s storage  following the steps above 

2  Back at the main file manager view  select the files again 

3  Tap and hold on the selected items to enter drag and drop mode 

4  Move your finger over the  Android  folder  then the  data  folder 

5  Keep moving your finger through the folder hierarchy  and once you re inside the folder that the files will be placed into  release your finger 

    What Google should have done

So yes  it s kind of a roundabout way to manage files that were previously considered publically accessible in Android 10 and earlier   It s an unfortunate change that Google could have handled better 

  As part of the Scoped Storage changes  there is a new permission   MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE   that is intended specifically for file manager apps to use so that they can have the broad access they need for the user to manage files under Android 11   Unfortunately  even with this broad permission   file managers _still_ cannot access files under  Android data   https   developer android com training data storage manage all files operations allowed manage external storage    Since apps with the  MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE  permission have to be vetted by Google before they are approved for distribution in the Play Store  it doesn t make sense for file managers to still be disallowed access to this directory for security reasons   Apps holding this permission should be allowed to manage the entirety of external storage as they were under Android 10 and earlier 

  Google could have tested the AOSP files app a bit better  especially since  they specifically implemented the ability to manage files inside  Android data  just for this one app  https   issuetracker google com issues 151765093 comment33    Looking at the code for the files app  the  main file manager activity  https   android googlesource com platform packages apps DocumentsUI   refs heads master src com android documentsui files Config java 34  is configured to use this access  but not the  picker activity  https   android googlesource com platform packages apps DocumentsUI   refs heads master src com android documentsui picker Config java   used for copying   moving files    You d think that some basic QA testing for this use case would have caught this issue before Android 11 was finalized  but since  the AOSP files app is going to be sunset in favor of Files by Google  https   issuetracker google com issues 163065203 comment5   it s no surprise that testing wasn t a huge priority 

  Frankly  they shouldn t have limited access to the  Android data  directory at all   Preventing other apps from accessing the directory basically turns it into a redundant copy of an app s existing internal storage area  located under   data data  lt package name gt  files   There used to be a clear distinction between an app s  internal storage directory  https   developer android com reference kotlin android content Context getfilesdir  and its  external storage directory  https   developer android com reference kotlin android content Context getexternalfilesdir    Now with Android 11  there s very little difference between the two

716,"FYI TIL   Google s Find My Phone  Play Sound  function is overridden by the Do Not Disturb function  Last night  during my DND time  I thought I d lost my phone  couldn t find it anywhere  Called it  no ringing heard in the house  Afraid I d left it somewhere I pull up the Maps timeline and it says it s here at home  So I used the  Play Sound for 5 minutes  function   nothing  Played it a number of times  walking round the house  the yard  etc  Nothing 

This morning I tried again and it immediately rang in the house  It had fallen on to a chair and was covered by something 

The  Play Sound  section says  Device will ring for 5 minutes  even if set to silent  but apparently not if it s during the DND timeframe  the DND function overrides it 

So if you re trying to locate your phone be aware that if it s during the DND time it cannot be made to ring 

In DND I do not have many exceptions so I don t know how it would play out if  for instance   Repeat Callers  is enabled 

Edit  OK  everyone saying it works  and I don t doubt it did for them  then any ideas what happened when I tried it  It did not play for me  It s not possible it rang and I didn t hear it 

The only exception I had for DND was  Media   everything else was blocked  For those it worked for what are your DND exceptions  

I m on Google Fi  don t know if the carrier makes any difference
