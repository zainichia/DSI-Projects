    "# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Project 2! It's time to start modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model\n",
    "2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process\n",
    "3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle to give you the opportunity to practice the following skills:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refining models over time\n",
    "- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process\n",
    "- The use of Kaggle as a place to practice data science\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, you will be submitting a technical report and a presentation. **You may find that the best model for Kaggle is not the best model to address your data science problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin working on this project, please do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign up for an account on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "2. **IMPORTANT**: Click this link ([Regression Challenge Sign Up](https://www.kaggle.com/t/cf68f4a276f44b59a3c6c843dbf9ed1e)) to **join** the competition (otherwise you will not be able to make submissions!)\n",
    "3. Review the material on the [DSI-US-6 Regression Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge)\n",
    "4. Review the [data description](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Modeling Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.\n",
    "2. Generate your regression model using the training data. We expect that within this process, you'll be making use of:\n",
    "    - train-test split\n",
    "    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters\n",
    "    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables\n",
    "    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)\n",
    "3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and submit your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.\n",
    "    - **Note**: Kaggle expects to see your submissions in a specific format. Check the challenge's page to make sure you are formatting your CSVs correctly!\n",
    "    - **You are limited to models you've learned in class**. In other words, you cannot use XGBoost, Neural Networks or any other advanced model for this project.\n",
    "4. Evaluate your models!\n",
    "    - consider your evaluation metrics\n",
    "    - consider your baseline score\n",
    "    - how can your model be used for inference?\n",
    "    - why do you believe your model will generalize to new data?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials must be submitted by 9AM on Nov 23rd.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your technical report will be hosted on Github Enterprise. Make sure it includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A README.md (that isn't this file)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rubric\n",
    "Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scores will be out of 27 points based on the 9 items in the rubric.** <br>\n",
    "*3 points per section*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Score | Interpretation |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |\n",
    "| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |\n",
    "| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |\n",
    "| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |\n",
