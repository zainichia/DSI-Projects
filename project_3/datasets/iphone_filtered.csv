22,"So I ve been using Android phones since about 10 years now  I ve seen the progression from 2 3 all the way up to 11 

Most recently  I had a Pixel 2XL  which I wanted to upgrade from  Google completely destroyed my dreams of having another Pixel because of 2 reasons 

1  They didn t launch the latest Pixel 5 in my region at all 
2  They were making budget phones  No flagship stuff 

I was thinking of OnePlus but the UI has started moving away from the clean stock android it used to be  I never wanted to use a Samsung because I absolutely abhor the One UI 

So I was  naturally  left with only one option  Turn over to the other side  Think Apple 

The biggest thing that has stopped me from getting an iPhone in the past was that

1  Complete lack of homescreen customisation  It would have driven me up walls if I had to use a phone where every single installed app is just lying on the homescreen with no way to clean it up  No widgets either  iOS 14 changed that  Finally you can run a clean home screen  and have an app drawer that s arguably better than Android 
2  Up until iPhone 11  the camera was just not at par with the Pixels overall  It had its redeeming points  but until 11  night sight was a complete miss  That changed too 

Thanks to these 2 changes  I even considered an iPhone  I timed it right  browsed the web a lot  and managed to get an iPhone 11 Pro Max 64GB for about 15  cheaper than the general market price 

It s been a month now  and here are a few thoughts 

1  The battery life is absolutely insane  I can go through about a day and more in a single charge  and that too without even charging past 90   My average screentime is like 4 5 hours a day  I m especially impressed by how little battery it consumes in traditionally power hungry tasks like photos  long videos  audio recordings  On standby it barely sips battery  This is the power of complete custom integration  and Google  I hope you learn this 
2  The cameras are fantastic  The images are usually a bit less contrast y than I used to get on my Pixel  but that s something I m getting used  What I noticed is that the iPhone captures far better dynamic range when there s enough light  The natural DoF on the cameras is so good  I m enjoying having an ultra wide and a proper 2x telephoto  I especially love the camera UI showing the areas just outside the current frame  Again  only possible through custom SoC integration power 
3  The videos are absolutely sublime  The stabilisation  the seamless switching between the lenses  I love it 
4  The UI  I have finally found the perfect UI  The left pane with some basic widgets  a single completely empty homescreen with 4 icons at the bottom  Thought I wish they were 5   and an app drawer that organises apps by category  Perfection  On Android I used to create folders on the home screen manually and categorise apps in them    Yikes 
5  Almost every single app that I used on Android is way better on iOS  Biggest betrayal being how much more usable Chrome is on iOS than Android  WTF Google  The apps are well designed  the long press actions are ahmazing 
6  Wireless charging  I used to be very skeptical of it before  But now I got an Aukey charging dock thingy  and I m loving the convenience 
7  Face ID  The speed is fantastic  and it s pretty seamless  I only wish you could just half swipe on the lock screen to unlock it  It s annoying having to swipe from the very bottom on a 6 5  screen  Also  the way the wireless dock is placed on my work desk  I can simply glance to the phone when I have a notification  and Face ID will instantly show me the notification content  That is pretty cool 
8  Though now in the mask era  Face ID is a bit annoying  I know that there are ways to enroll with the mask  but apart from that  I miss the finger print for its ease in such situations 
9  My only biggest gripe with the whole thing is that for some reason no app can differentiate between  folders  of sorts  I hate that downloaded media  media that I send through whatsapp  all get pooled with my camera photos  and if I enable backup  it will stupidly backup everything  I don t want that  The Apple  Photos  app does have different  albums   but there s no option to backup only the camera photos because there is no Camera  album   I have not found any workaround solution for this yet   I am aware that Whatsapp has a setting to disable saving to camera roll  But that only applies to incoming media  Media that I click in whatsapp and then send still gets saved to camera roll  

Overall  I m pretty damn happy I made the switch

32,"I have relatively small hands  Back when I had a Plus size phone  a total game changer in typing was getting a case with a finger ring handle so that I didn t need to grip both sides of the phone to hold it 
I ve avoided the newer Max phones because I like to use wireless charging  and many of the ring options make it incompatible   
With MagSafe it could be easily detachable  in theory   
Now I ve seen mixed reviews on how strong MagSafe is  and it sounds like half of it is reliant on the size weight of the magnets in the client product  So I m just wondering if it would be feasible to have a magnetic back  or some type of magnetic case  super easy to remove  that would hold well enough for a ring use case  I haven t seen any decent product really try to do both things  so I m also curious if it s something I could modify make  which I ve done in the past 
Thank you for your help 
  
Edit   

Thanks for the info everyone  Sounds like I should wait and see if someone like PopSocket attempts a MagSafe model

35,"Given that I upgraded from a iPhone 11 Pro Max to the 12 Pro Max purely for photography  I was excited as hell to download the latest developer beta and give the ProRAW photo capabilities of the iPhone 12 a run for it s money 

So far the phone has been fantastic  with the bigger sensor helping me out in dark environments taking pics of my dog with a great deal more detail and a lot lower shutter time  it s impossible to make a corgi sit still    But  for the most part I haven t seen too much of a difference between the iPhone 11 and 12 

With the new Beta on hand  and ProRAW set up and ready to go  I decided to go to a cliff near my place  and see the differences between the two formats  and how good Apple s ProRAW implementation really is 

Bear in mind ProRAW isn t instantly going to make your pictures any better from the offset  RAW pictures capture a lot more data  allowing you to edit the picture with less artifact s from compression algorithms like JPEG 

As such  this is a test to see how your typical images may look should you wish to spend a little more time on them in post processing rather than snapping and going like you usually would on an iPhone 

  The Photos

I chose three photos from the walk  and will include one portrait pic that is not RAW  but one which I was thoroughly impressed with considering it s surprising quality compared to my A6300 at home  Each photo will look at Apples dynamic range  and the differences between their normal Smart HDR and RAW quality 

Each ProRAW pic was edited in isolation  without looking at the original picture at all  with all pics being editing purely on what I felt looked best   As you ll see below  all ProRAW pics before editing are dark  but in that photo they contain a lot of data to play with  which I have tried my best to edit to what I remembered seeing at that time

So here  there s not too much difference between the two pics  Apart from the added flexibility that the ProRAW format allowed me in regards to changing the white balance and a few hues  most aspects of this picture is the same  I wanted a tiny bit more  drama  in the pic  so I upped the texture and clarity  resulting in a slightly darker take  but otherwise  apart from the extra contrast and different white balance  the two pics almost look identical 

Should I have made these edits to the original pic  not ProRAW  I expect there d be some pixelation  but as a whole the original Smart HDR really holds up well

Once again  the biggest thing you re going to notice here is the  Drama  from the sunset  The Smart HDR is a fantastic photo  but whilst it s accurate  it s also pretty flat  and doesn t capture the imagination of what it was like to be walking along that cliff 

Take  for example  the trees in the foreground   whilst I could see them clear as day  when taking a pic like this I want the viewer to  feel  what it s like to see the sunset over the hill in the distance  something the warmer tone and less brightness on the shadows helps to portray to the viewer 

Overall  the Smart HDR pic is fantastic  and is a great starting point  but the RAW has so much data and flexibility  which really allows you to bring out the photo s true potential

And here s the final comparison of the pics  The Smart HDR in this pic is definitely more accurate to what we were seeing on the day   there was more pink in the sky than orange  but the original pic misses that punch that most people want to see in a sunset  with the dark countryside but bright colourful sky 

The clouds were also so much more vibrant than the original SmartHDR lets on  with it turning out flat when compared to the ProRAW version  From what I recall on the day  the sunset was actually somewhere between the two  with the sky having more pinkness in it  whilst having more depth and tone in the clouds 

The fact I took this with ProRAW and was able to bring out that depth  without massive artifacts  is a testament to how far the ProRAW format can be pushed

As I said before  I couldn t get over how good the portrait mode has gotten over the last few years and this is what blew me away

The bokeh  in dim lighting due to the sunset  and with the 2 5x telephoto lens  really blew me away  The fact that my dog s body gets blurrier the further back you look  sharp at face  blurrier towards tail  is astounding  and whilst the glitches are still there  the lead seems to have become slightly bokeh d half way up   I m sure many would be forgiven for thinking this was taken with my A6300 

In addition  the stabilisation of the primary wide angle sensor on the Max is breathtaking  Just take a look at this handheld footage of the sunset  with no editing at all

  Conclusion

As can probably be seen above  whilst some of the ProRAW pics may look  subjectively  better  the pics that come straight out of the iPhone using SmartHDR are genuinely fantastic  and really do make anyone a true photographer capable of creating stunning pics 

ProRAW will be a fantastic addition to any photographers toolset  and the fact Apple s processing still occurs in addition to all the extra data you get to play with is genuinely fantastic  but for vast majority of the time you ll just want to shoot normal SmartHDR pics  I wouldn t  in my case  say the extra half an hour to an hour of sorting through and editing the best pics was really worth it  considering how little difference there is between the iPhone Smart HDR and ProRAW pics 

This value judgement is  of course  going to be dependent on the situation   for most users  ProRAW will likely never be used  or only used in extremely specific circumstances  e g  a very special occasion they want to remember for life   but as a whole it s a great little feature for budding photographers and professionals alike 

Going forwards  I ll likely leave ProRAW off for the most part  only using it should I see some truly fantastic things that I want to spend the extra time and effort on  The sunset pic is a great example of those times I d want to use it  otherwise for general day to day usage  SmartHDR reigns supreme 

  Edit  Had to edit as some of the original smartHDR pics weren t uploading correctly  likely due to iOS beta doing something different with  jpegs  So reuploaded

If you care about why I made it 

So basically I graduated from college this summer and moved to a new city for my job  I m pretty much completely alone in this new city and it s basically impossible to make new friends right now because of the whole pandemic situation  Let s just say my mental health has not been great and I have felt pretty overwhelmed and not really sure how to fix anything 

A lot of times I felt like I just wanted to talk to someone about something to feel better but it s really hard to reach out to people because it feels like they re still living their lives and don t have time for you  This app is essentially just a way to reach out to anyone and have a random conversation about anything so that you can talk about your problems or anything that makes life feel just a bit more normal

99,"I went to the Apple store earlier today and informed them of the flickering screen issue and that I was able to reproduce the problem on my iPhone 12 Pro Max in a dark room with low brightness  Genius rep ran diagnostics on the device and showed me that everything passed  Genius rep recommended a hard reset which I did in store with the rep  Was not able to verify flickering issue in store due to bright light  Rep said that it is most likely a software issue  Told rep that if the problem persists what should I do  rep said to hard reset every week or so  Asked if software update to 14 3 that s coming out doesn t fix the issue  what should be my next step  rep said to come back so that they can investigate further  Just got home and was able to verify that the problem still persists after a hard reset with no restore of back up  Wondering if I should return my device before the 14 day return window 

Edit  Problem is evident in Safari when playing video in portrait mode and low brightness  Top and bottom black sections flicker every couple seconds but not consistently like in the YouTube app that occurs every second with black screen test

I booked an appointment to an apple service centre because of the infamous yellow tint  whites look yellow and greys look greenish   I got a chance to compare my phone to the display unit at 2 different stores  apple stores and reliance digital which is one of the official sellers here in India  and compared the models there to my device 

The units at both the stores were similar to my phone and their display was the same as well  I compared my 12 with the 12 mini and there was a slight difference but 12s were exactly similar 

  The display units had higher brightness at max settings as compared to my phone  but that could be an internal setting when phones are kept on display mode  There was no difference in colour 

  Now regarding the service centre  they told me that apple is doing an internal investigation and this issue has been brought into their notice and the service centre people are not allowed to perform any changes to the 12 as of now   They showed me the notice and it said 12 specifically  the mini or the pros were not mentioned 

So hopefully this is a minor issue and is sorted by apple 

Would love to discuss this in the comments    Update regarding iphone 12 yellow tint",iphone,booked appointment apple service centre infamous yellow tint white look yellow grey look greenish got chance compare display unit different store apple store reliance digital one official seller india compared model device unit store similar display well compared mini slight difference exactly similar display unit higher brightness max setting compared could internal setting phone kept display mode difference colour regarding service centre told apple internal investigation issue brought notice service centre people allowed perform change showed notice said specifically mini pro mentioned hopefully minor issue sorted apple would love discus comment update regarding yellow tint

123,"Looking to hear your thoughts  I upgraded via the IUP  and while happy with the new design I can t help but feel like it s not a worthwhile upgrade for me personally  The 11 Pro Max was the best phone I ve ever had and I kind of miss it even though I haven t mailed it for trade in yet  It just feels better in my hand  not as wide as the 12 PM  I could reach across the width of the 11 pro Max screen with my thumb easily but can t make it to the Edge of the screen with the 12 which makes it uncomfortable  I don t take a lot of low light shots so not noticing much of a difference in day shots  A13 and A14 are blazing fast so trying to compare in everyday use is difficult  I don t have good 5G coverage in my area so comparing to my LTE speeds on the 11 Pro Max shows little difference

138,"My understanding is that the 12 Pro Max uses sensor shift image stabilization as opposed to software stabilization found in the 12 Pro and some other iPhones  

I know that sensor shift image stabilization moves the camera sensors in some way  But depending on the source  I ve read that the sensor movement is achieved by gyroscope  or tiny actuators or they re simply floating in some suspension  

There is a surprising lack of info about the Pro Max s sensor shift image stabilization  How does it work

140,"Hey everyone  I hope you are doing well 

I just got robbed  and one week ago I found a phone that looks exactly like mine on Facebook market place  I m going to head and meet the seller and check the IMEI number of that phone 

I don t want to look suspicious that s why I m gonna remember some of the IMEI number  And then compare it with the phone I m going to be looking at 

However  I m pretty worried that phones of the same models  Let s say Iphone 6s plus  Have similar IMEI and just some of the number changed  Or it is that all phones have random numbers regardless of the model 

Thank you in advance  as this will help me make the right decision  To inform the cops or not  

EDIT   For some reason I thought that Reddit deleted my post  Like it always does   I just came here by mistake and found lots of comments  Thank you everyone for being concerned over my safety 

What Happened   I managed to meet the person who s selling the phone and he brought his friend  I think  with him  I checked the IMEI number  it sure is really close to the one I had  I memorized it  But it is different  Guess similar models have similar IMEIs indeed   However  I noticed one thing   The seller doesn t have the box and earphones  and not even the charger  Plus  he was really nervous  he was shaking and moving a lot  Also  the neighborhood he lived in has a very bad reputation  I m pretty sure the phone he has is stolen too    It is a new model  No way someone wouldn t have the charger  In my country the police are assholes    They do have the resources to track down with IMEIs anyone they want  yet they only choose to do it for rich people or companies  And if I ever told them that I suspect someone has a stolen phone  they wouldn t give a damn about it  So at least while I can t do the person who s got their phone stolen justice  I sent this message to the seller   I know the phone is stolen  I gave your details  pictures and the phone details to the police   I might be a douchebag and its their phone  but if it isn t at least they will have some rough days xD

157,"EDIT  Appears this is limited to the XR  XS  XS Max  and new SE 

I know iPhones since the 11 series have had the ability to choose aspect ratios  4 3  16 9  1 1  in the native camera app  without the user needing to crop afterwards  Until now  AFAIK  older models like the XS haven t had the ability to choose 16 9 in the camera app  just  Photo  or  Square    However it seems that with 14 2  or maybe it was even in 14 1 or 14 0  the aspect ratio control has been added  Just swipe up on the word  Photo  to choose the aspect ratio  I just found this on a XS Max just now by accident 

Anyone else can confirm that this works on even older models  Cropping is hardly processing intensive  so I would think this applies to all models running 14 2 

Hardly life changing  of course  but to me 16 9 is usually a better aspect ratio for pictures  so it s a nice convenience to be able to choose it rather than cropping afterwards 

 Sorry if this has already been documented  but I did not find any mentions on Reddit or even among top Google results  just people asking for Apple to add this feature to older iPhones   TIL you can now take 16 9 photos on older iPhones",iphone,edit appears limited xr x x max new se know since series ability choose aspect ratio native camera app without user needing crop afterwards afaik older model like x ability choose camera app photo square however seems maybe even aspect ratio control added swipe word photo choose aspect ratio found x max accident anyone else confirm work even older model cropping hardly processing intensive would think applies model running hardly life changing course usually better aspect ratio picture nice convenience able choose rather cropping afterwards sorry already documented find mention even among top google result people asking apple add feature older til take photo older

164,"Hello Reddit  today I wanted to share my Battery Usage and give you as much info as I can and maybe it ll help you decide if you should upgrade to the iPhone 12  or 12 pro  or keep your existing smartphone

 amp  x200B 

I got my iPhone on launch day  Oct 23rd  and have been using it as my daily driver ever since  I don t own any other smartphones so the iPhone 12 Pro has been my only device since it launched 

 amp  x200B 

In the first 2 weeks I ve seen some of the most odd battery life behavior I have ever seen in a smartphone    like seriously I was at 5  by 3pm on 2 days within the first 2 weeks and some days it would last me to 6pm or 7pm but wouldn t get me anywhere near the end of my day which sometimes could be Midnight to 2am  phone usually comes off the charger at around 8am to 9am 

 amp  x200B 

One of those days within the 2 weeks  literally right after complaining on Reddit  I got some of the BEST battery life I ve ever had on any smartphone    took the phone off the charger at 12 23pm and the phone lasted me to 11 50pm with 59  battery life still remaining   full logs of the days could be found in the descriptions of my youtube videos but I don t wanna link them because I don t want to get banned    so yeah 

 amp  x200B 

But I only had that great amazing battery life once in the first two weeks    after that it went right back to being below average  well at least compared to my 11 pro 

 amp  x200B 

After the first two weeks Apple released iOS 14 2 and ever since I updated to that software I have seen more consistent battery life    every day since iOS 14 2 has been installed I have been getting over 5 hours of Screen On Time  which was something I was struggling to accomplish in the first two weeks 

 amp  x200B 

Below is a log of one of my first days with iOS 14 2 installed but if you don t wanna read through that whole thing the best way to sum it up would be this  iOS 14 2 while not being a Miracle Update to  fix my battery drastically by any means it definitely helped get me through a full day consistently  and depending your usage maybe up to 2 days  my only problem I had with my iPhone 12 Pro was that the battery was HORRIBLE like one of my YouTube video titles said    it was really making me think about returning it and getting either an iPhone 11 Pro again OR getting a Google Pixel 4a Pixel 5 and a dedicated camera for making my YouTube videos with  But after iOS 14 2 released all of the issues I had have been somewhat fixed and I can definitely leave the house without bringing the charger with me like I used to 

 amp  x200B 

Notes  

1  my standby time since launch has been nothing short of perfect    I have not lost 1  on pretty much every night that I ve had the phone  I can only recall 2 nights where the phone lost 2  or 3  over night   Overnight for me is around 6 to 9 hours off the charger 
2  I started with the iPhone 11 Pro charging block but read that the new 20W is better for magsafe so I sold the old one and purchased the new 20W but it hasn t changed the battery life by any means  That should be pretty obvious but I thought I should mention it 
3  I am now getting over 5 Hours of Screen On Time per day which has been fantastic but my iPhone 11 Pro was getting minimum of 6 to 7 hours of screen on time which is why I ve been a little disappointed with the 12 Pro s battery life so far   

If you re in the market for a new smartphone and the iPhone 12 Series is on your mind  the design  cameras and iOS is an amazing combination and as long as you re not coming from a battery champ of any kind the iPhone 12 Pro should be a great all day smartphone for you  Especially if you re like me and the Max is just too big

So if you re accustomed to using the XSMax one handed  and are worried about upgrading to the Pro Max   I don t think the size would be where you run into issues  but the weight might be  so keep that in mind or maybe make an appointment at the Apple store to put your hands on one before buying

172,"Hello 

So at time of writing I ve been using my PM for about 24 hours now  I upgraded from an iPhone X 

Some   personal   thoughts 

 amp  x200B 

Pros 

 The battery   Feels absolutely insane  I have about 2h screen on time since charging today  and the battery is at 79  at the moment  Downloaded loads of apps and thousands of spotify songs yesterday  battery was at 60  ish when plugging it into the charger  Such a MASSIVE upgrade from my X which never lasted an entire day for me in the end 

 The size   It s pretty much perfect I would say  I have average sized hands and haven t noticed any problems with one handed usage  It fits pretty good in my pocket  nothing more to say there really  Also the new design just feels sooo good in my hands 

 The RAM   My old X couldn t handle more than 3 4 apps sometimes before killing a background process  It happened waaay too many times that I browsed youtube  opened up snapchat and reddit  then when going back to youtube it reloaded the app  Haven t happened yet on my PM  despite opening way more apps 

 amp  x200B 

Neutral 

 The cameras   I am not a photographer and I did   not   buy this phone for the cameras  Most of my camera roll is just saved memes from Reddit  However  after comparing photos from both my X and my 12 PM  the differences are noticeable  but not major in any way  It feels better in low light  though  Will probably do some more testing when the weather is not 1000  rain 

 The price   Let s be real  most people buying this phone is not on a budget  You buy this if you want the best  Phones these days   are   expensive  I think the argument  how can a phone cost 1k that s insane  is ridiculous  It s not for you then  Just get a cheaper one 

 amp  x200B 

Cons 

I have to say  the weight   This is expected from such a big phone obviously  however  especially when lying in bed and watching youtube or whatever  my hand gets really tired after a while  I find it hard to use the phone one handed for longer periods 

 3D touch   I have to add this  It was such a nice feature on my X to just press hard anywhere on the keyboard to move the cursor  Now I have to press long on the spacebar  takes some time getting used to 

Questions  Thoughts from other Pro Max users  iPhone 12 Pro Max   First 24 hours thoughts ",iphone,hello time writing using pm hour upgraded x personal thought x b pro battery feel absolutely insane h screen time since charging today battery moment downloaded load apps thousand spotify song yesterday battery ish plugging charger massive upgrade x never lasted entire day end size pretty much perfect would say average sized hand noticed problem one handed usage fit pretty good pocket nothing say really also new design feel sooo good hand ram old x handle apps sometimes killing background process happened waaay many time browsed youtube opened snapchat going back youtube reloaded app happened yet pm despite opening way apps x b neutral camera photographer buy camera camera roll saved meme however comparing photo x pm difference noticeable major way feel better low light though probably testing weather rain price let real people buying budget buy want best phone day expensive think argument cost k insane ridiculous get cheaper one x b con say weight expected big obviously however especially lying bed watching youtube whatever hand get really tired find hard use one handed longer period touch add nice feature x press hard anywhere keyboard move cursor press long spacebar take time getting used question thought pro max user pro max first hour thought
173,"So I got the 12 pro max at launch yesterday and it is a great phone  I am happy with the purchase  However as I ve been using it  granted for a day so far  it dawned on me that I personally do not feel like my experience has changed in any significant way compared to the 8 plus 

The OLED screen is supposed to be far superior and probably is  but unless I put both phones next to one another I honestly couldn t tell much about it  The phone doesn t feel snappier in any way  which is understandable  as the 8 plus A11 is still more than capable for years to come and you can only get so  snappy   Probably a higher refresh rate display would have made me feel like I got a  jump  in performance  but alas Apple did not give us one with the 12 line up  

Face ID is a nice quality of life change from Touch ID  no more dreading sweaty fingers   but in the era of face masks in a pandemic  which will likely continue through 2021  it is losing its flair  

It s early to talk about battery life  the 8 plus lasted me at least a day and half  I don t expect different from the 12 pro max   but again this is likely to be another user experience feature  which barely differs between the two phones    


This post is more of a props for the 8 plus  than dissing the 12 pro max  The 12 pro max is great  I just don t feel like it s tangibly greater than the 8 plus in daily non specialized use  Sure  it s a Pro  it s meant for the  power users   but honestly you can get the same value of power usage in the older phones  As old as t he 8 plus as evidenced by my experience  I honestly feel like after the 8 plus it has become incredibly difficult to actually upgrade the user experience and all the advancements  such as LIDAR  bigger camera sensor  etc  have been very niche and honestly felt by a very small percentage of the user base  For the casual one shot photo snapper who needs a reliable phone  the new iPhone lineups have failed to deliver any tangible improvements  that s the case across all smartphones  but Apple is the only manufacture to have 3 4 year old phones  which are completely viable to use today    


The 8 plus was my first iPhone and this experience upgrading makes me recommend  buying two generations behind simply for price experience ratio  As things stand I could not suggest you actually pay this money for any reason other than  got the newest phone   You can use your phone until it gets dropped by software support and be confident you are not missing much  8 plus to 12 pro max   doesn t feel like much of an upgrade",iphone,got pro max launch yesterday great happy purchase however using granted day far dawned personally feel like experience changed significant way compared plus oled screen supposed far superior probably unless put phone next one another honestly tell much feel snappier way understandable plus still capable year come get snappy probably higher refresh rate display would made feel like got jump performance ala apple give u one line face id nice quality life change touch id dreading sweaty finger era face mask pandemic likely continue losing flair early talk battery life plus lasted least day half expect different pro max likely another user experience feature barely differs two phone post prop plus dissing pro max pro max great feel like tangibly greater plus daily non specialized use sure pro meant power user honestly get value power usage older phone old plus evidenced experience honestly feel like plus become incredibly difficult actually upgrade user experience advancement lidar bigger camera sensor etc niche honestly felt small percentage user base casual one shot photo snapper need reliable new lineup failed deliver tangible improvement case across smartphones apple manufacture year old phone completely viable use today plus first experience upgrading make recommend buying two generation behind simply price experience ratio thing stand could suggest actually pay money reason got newest use get dropped software support confident missing much plus pro max feel like much upgrade

175,"Hello  I just wanted to share what I did just now 

For the past few years I ve been a huge fan of magnetic mounts  in the car and around the home  I ve been using the Scosche mounts for many years  and with the announcement of the MagSafe mounts that was quite exciting for me 

As MagSafe on iPhone is in the infancy and there are a handful of products announced  though nothing available for purchase other then the Apple MagSafe charger  I came up with my own mount 

I m using an Arkon brand floor mount  attached to seat bolt  which has an AMPS bracket  The only reason I m using this is my car has no real ideal dash mount spot  BMW i3   With the bracket I used some 3M command strips to stick the Apple charger to the ball head 

I don t have pics of the phone on it  as I didn t bring my other phone and it s cold out right now  Though I m quite satisfied with it  and I have the phone a good shake and it holds strong  This is with the weight of a 12 pro max with an Apple case on it

223,"Hey everyone

I have never used one of the newer phones and thus have 0 experience with night mode 

When watching reviews I noticed that the camera app does not let you pick the exposure time for night mode beyond what it recommends based on stabilization and lighting conditions  I presume  

In the review of the 12 Pro Max by The Verge  the reviewer mentioned that in conditions where the 12 Pro needed 3 seconds exposure  the iPhone 12 Pro Max might only need 1 second  because of the increased performance in low light  

__So   __ If I would like  for whatever reason  to take a longer exposure than what the phone recommends  I have no option to do that  Also  will the maximum exposure on a tripod also be affected  or will that still he capped at 30 seconds  

_Example _ If I wanna take a handheld picture of the stars  and a 12 Pro would recommend 9 10 seconds and the 12 Pro Max recommends 3 5 seconds  I cannot manually choose a 9 10 second exposure to capture the stars better 

I must say  that if the larger sensor only means we get the ability to take low light long exposures _faster_  instead of being able to take _the same length of exposures much better_  that would be a little disappointing  

Thanks in advance  Clarification on Night Mode for iPhone",iphone,hey everyone never used one newer phone thus experience night mode watching review noticed camera app let pick exposure time night mode beyond recommends based stabilization lighting condition presume review pro max verge reviewer mentioned condition pro needed second exposure pro max might need second increased performance low light would like whatever reason take longer exposure recommends option also maximum exposure tripod also affected still capped second example wanna take handheld picture star pro would recommend second pro max recommends second cannot manually choose second exposure capture star better must say larger sensor mean get ability take low light long exposure faster instead able take length exposure much better would little disappointing thanks advance clarification night mode

284,"I must be going crazy   I ve been upgrading iPhones every 2 years for as long as I can remember   I currently have the iPhone XS which I ve loved and am still impressed with the camera  speed  form factor   I just received my new iPhone 12 Pro and I thought I would really love it but here are a few reasons why I m going to return it  

1  Camera is good but certainly doesn t blow the XS out of the water  I take a lot of photos of my 2 year old indoors and for that type of photography  it improves the graininess a bit and creates a sharper picture but you certainly have to zoom in to see the differences   
2  Performance is good but not seeing a massive improvement in speed     
3  The form factor is the biggest reason I m returning it   For me  the XS fit so snuggly in my hand and i was able to get to most of the screen with my thumb   The 12 Pro has been increased in size AND  a bit AND  the flat edges make it much harder to hold   I measured the girth with measuring tape and it s definitely larger   It s much heavier and just feels like overkill   Again  this really isn t a big increase in size but the increase tipped it over into the  too big  category  

The thing I will really miss though is the 6GB of ram and having all the apps stay open   That s pretty amazing  but not at the expense of the above   And the battery life  it s pretty good   

I honestly don t know what phone to get  11 Pro because it has the old form factor or maybe the 12 Mini but I d miss the telephoto with the 12 Mini    

Am I crazy or is anyone also not happy with it  Why I m returning the iPhone 12 Pro ",iphone,must going crazy upgrading every year long remember currently x loved still impressed camera speed form factor received new pro thought would really love reason going return camera good certainly blow x water take lot photo year old indoors type photography improves graininess bit creates sharper picture certainly zoom see difference performance good seeing massive improvement speed form factor biggest reason returning x fit snuggly hand able get screen thumb pro increased size bit flat edge make much harder hold measured girth measuring tape definitely larger much heavier feel like overkill really big increase size increase tipped big category thing really miss though gb ram apps stay open pretty amazing expense battery life pretty good honestly know get pro old form factor maybe mini miss telephoto mini crazy anyone also happy returning pro

291,"At first I liked the idea of an iPhone mini because it had a similar size to the original iPhone SE   The main reason I loved the SE was because I could hold the phone in a certain way that would allow me to reach every point on the screen comfortably with my thumb without readjusting my grip a true one handed phone  

But unfortunately this will not be the case for the mini   While the physical size of the mini is the same as the SE  the display is much larger   So you ll still have to readjust your grip to reach every point of the screen making it not much better than the larger size iPhones  

What we need is an iPhone micro that has the same physical dimensions of the SE minus the large bezel   Who s with me  We need an iPhone micro",iphone,first liked idea mini similar size original se main reason loved se could hold certain way would allow reach every point screen comfortably thumb without readjusting grip true one handed unfortunately case mini physical size mini se display much larger still readjust grip reach every point screen making much better larger size need micro physical dimension se minus large bezel need micro

The design just did it for me and the screen to body ratio  I am going to miss some stuff that I could do on android and some apps that I so heavily relied on that I wont get on the iPhone  Apps like Vanced which I will be missing the most 
 But I guess I cannot have it all  Was getting bored of software update inconsistencies and cameras not being at par except the Pixel 

I am still a lil concerned about battery life on the 12 as my current phone has 3300 mAH  Wonder how much the 5 nm processor is going to make  will it save or will it kill more battery

353,"I ve had my iPhone 12 Pro with an Apple Silicone Case for 1 5 weeks now and I wanted to share my thoughts with all of you since Apple doesn t allow reviews to be added to their store anymore 

OVERALL  A great case that offers solid protection and grip  but introduced a few quality of life issues that may bother some 

PROS

 	Relatively small footprint  but not the thinnest case
 	Protects the phone around the entire edge  there s no longer a bottom lip cutout 
 	Covers the rear camera without having a raised lip
 	Includes MagSafe without the white outlines  I have not used MagSafe  but it works fine with a Qi wireless charger 
 	Has that soft but grippy texture that allows me to hold the phone with one hand  confidentially knowing I am less likely to drop it due to butter fingers 

CONS

 	The cutout for the charging port has sharp edges  which my hand constantly rubs against  It s quite annoying and I still notice it regularly 
 	When holding the phone with both hands in landscape mode  one hand naturally rests over the bottom speaker holes  causing me to muffle the sound from one side entirely  This leads to a lack of stereo sound unless I consciously raise my finer off the speaker holes  This can be annoying when playing games like COD Mobile 
 	Expensive  You can buy other cases for much cheaper  but there are quite few that support MagSafe charging right now  

NEUTRAL

 	Like other silicone cases  this can easily attract pocket lint and oils  but it s a completely acceptable trade off for the grippyness factor 
 	The quality seems on par with past versions  With regular use  expect the case to last about 1 year before you notice visible wear and tear in the corners or edges  YMMV  iPhone 12 Apple Silicone Case",iphone,pro apple silicone case week wanted share thought since apple allow review added store anymore overall great case offer solid protection grip introduced quality life issue may bother pro relatively small footprint thinnest case protects around entire edge longer bottom lip cutout cover rear camera without raised lip includes magsafe without white outline used magsafe work fine qi wireless charger soft grippy texture allows hold one hand confidentially knowing le likely drop due butter finger con cutout charging port sharp edge hand constantly rub quite annoying still notice regularly holding hand landscape mode one hand naturally rest bottom speaker hole causing muffle sound one side entirely lead lack stereo sound unless consciously raise finer speaker hole annoying playing game like cod mobile expensive buy case much cheaper quite support magsafe charging right neutral like silicone case easily attract pocket lint oil completely acceptable trade grippyness factor quality seems par past version regular use expect case last year notice visible wear tear corner edge ymmv apple silicone case

372,"Apple will never put Touch ID in the iPhone ever again  Save yourself the disappointment folks 

I find it amusing and bizarre that a majority of people who know how Apple operates   hope  that Apple adds Touch ID back into the iPhone 
It s one thing to wish for it from a purely wishlist hypothetical standpoint  which is fine 
But I see a lot of people genuinely thinking that there could be a chance it may come back  and desperately hoping for the same  Thus setting themselves up for disappointment in the case that their wish doesn t come true 
To me  it s clear as day that Apple is the kind of company that would never ever go back on a technology as crucial as biometric authentication in their flagship products  that they themselves proudly replaced with something they advertised as superior  Face ID  
Apple s image is all about unreasonable levels of perfection in everything they do and make  about never taking a wrong decision with their products  think back to the  bravery  of removing the headphone jack   and about leading the industry into the future because they have the greatest minds working for them 

  

Do you remember the way they showed off Face ID during the keynote and in their ads  And how they compared it to Touch ID  so as to show that Face ID is perfect and superior in every conceivable way  Do you really think Apple is casually just going to go back on something that  lol 
Many customers may be pleased with such a decision but the kind of backlash they will get from the media in terms of headlines like  Apple brings back Touch ID  Implicitly acknowledges its inability to innovate  amp  know what s best for the customer  
Can you imagine that being something Apple would ever consciously do  The answer for me is a clear  Nope 

  

Finally  consider this 
They cannot ever add Touch ID back  even if they wanted to  because it would make for a frustrating and illogical user experience when combined with Face ID 
Not only would it be a waste of hardware to have the notch just for Face ID  it would also go against Apple s design principles of simplicity to have 2 different ways to do biometric authentication on a single device 
Between keeping Face ID  the fancy  new  superior tech they are extremely proud of  vs Touch ID  the old school tech that isn t nearly as secure  as the new default  Face ID is the obvious choice

373,"So I went into the Apple Store  Barcelona  Spain  yesterday to get my AirPod Pros swapped out  Sitting there waiting on the diagnostics to finish running  I was playing around with the 12 and the 12 Pro  

I m  admittedly  an  easy upsell  kind of guy  and I m also into the third telephoto lens of the  pro  line of phones  I m also in love with the  new  design   the throwback to my favorite iPhone 4  amp 5 

Having had both the 11 normal and 11 Pro  I figured getting the 12 Pro would be the logical next step  

So while I didn t go in looking to buy upgrade   I was open to it  

But holy hell was I disappointed with one major thing    the stainless steel siding on the 12 Pro  

Yeah  I read countless reviews about thumbprint marks   but it s not just that  Add to the usual thumbprints and you get oily stains skin stains  micro scratches  all on a material where the slightest mark looks glaringly bad  

In addition to the oil thumbprint scratch marks  what I couldn t get over was the cheap look to it  I will say this is muuuuch worse for the iPhone 12P in  silver   but overall  it s just not a  Pro  look to me  At all  It looks about as pro as rhinestones look like diamonds  

Long story short  this really caught me off guard  and I really refuse to drop a grand for something that looks like   IMO   cheap plastic material   This only applies to the sides   back is fine in my book  

Has anyone else seen in this boat  Any chance they ll drop the SS material in the 12S 13 etc   Anyone else turned off from the 12 Pro because of the stainless steel siding  It s legit the main reason I won t be getting it ",iphone,went apple store barcelona spain yesterday get airpod pro swapped sitting waiting diagnostics finish running playing around pro admittedly easy upsell kind guy also third telephoto lens pro line phone also love new design throwback favorite normal pro figured getting pro would logical next step go looking buy upgrade open holy hell disappointed one major thing stainless steel siding pro yeah read countless review thumbprint mark add usual thumbprint get oily stain skin stain micro scratch material slightest mark look glaringly bad addition oil thumbprint scratch mark get cheap look say muuuuch worse p silver overall pro look look pro rhinestone look like diamond long story short really caught guard really refuse drop grand something look like imo cheap plastic material applies side back fine book anyone else seen boat chance drop s material etc anyone else turned pro stainless steel siding legit main reason getting

390,"I am a die hard Vanilla Android user  I owned an iPhone 3GS but have been Android since then  With Google s failure at providing top tier hardware since forever  Pixel 3 XL was premium priced at mid range specs  Pixel 5 is shameful   and because I don t like Samsung s bloatware  I ve switched to the dark side  Here are some thoughts after a day of use 

Pros 

  Hardware is beautiful  The phone is ultra premium feeling  Screen is sharp and colorful  The frosted glass back is really nice 
   Accessories just look better  The official silicon case is really nice feeling  Magsafe charger is great 
  FaceID is great  Very fast and responsive 
  The camera shits all over any Android I ve seen  Androids with similar spec cameras do not compare  This is pretty huge  4k 60FPS video on iPhone 12 Pro vs 4k 60FPS video on Galaxy s20 Ultra is not even in the same ballpark  iPhone is way better 

Cons 

  More taps to do simple things vs Android 
  Why can t I add a quick shortcut for Night Shift in the settings dropdown thing  drag down from top right   I have to drag down  long hold screen brightness  tap night shift  tap turn on  This is 4 taps  I could do this with a swipe and 1 tap in Android  It s not even an option to add as a shortcut to this quick settings menu as far as I m seeing  Like the flashlight 
  Widgets are extremely underwhelming on iOS  I am used to having both a music and podcast widget that I can press Play or Pause directly on the widget  With iOS  the widget has to open the app up  and then I can pause or play  Widgets cannot be resized like they can on Android 
  Grid for apps is sequentially ordered from the top left strictly  I like to have my apps near the bottom of my screen closer to my thumb  I don t like a huge grid of apps  This is not achievable on iPhone without filling the entire screen with apps and then reordering my most used to the bottom of the screen  Any tips here 
  File management is a total failure  I can t download FOLDERS from Google Drive  I can only download and assign individual files from Google Drive to an iOS app  I have a collection of music organized into folders and I will have to figure out a way to import them easily quickly into iOS  
  Cannot set Apollo reddit app as the default app to open reddit links from the browser  What s up with this  I m only offered the official Reddit app as default 
  Automatic categorization of apps in app drawer  Requires 1 extra swipe in order to get an alphabetical list  What s up with this  Just give me an alphabetical grid  Cmon man 
  Seeing available Bluetooth devices requires a swipe and 2 long taps  Swipe down from top right  long tap bluetooth  long tap it once again in order to see the list  Android would be 1 swipe  1 long tap  

Overall  I m noticing just more menu diving   tapping   long tapping in order to get to the same settings and do things that should be quick  At least they were quicker on Android  Since I m not happy with any Android alternative this generation  I ll be able to live with these inconveniences for the next 2 years but I m not fully bought into the iOS hype  There are many things that are just flat out less user friendly than Android

395," 

I ve been a long time user of Android phones due to their affordability and customization  My first flagship Android phone was the Galaxy s3  I immediately fell in love with the design and overall functionality  All my friends and family would have iphones  but I would always stay true to Androids  Then I upgraded to the Galaxy s6 right before I left for college  At this point  I was a little bit upset as Androids weren t  and still aren t  optimized for Snapchat  as this is when my social life started to sky rocket  so much of my time was spent on that app 

2 years later in 2017 I switch to the Galaxy s8  Now  I loved this phone and it s been a killer 3 years with it  Awesome camera  lightning fast  amazing customization UI and just overall enjoyment 

I would always look over the fence though and see what Apple was up to with their iphones  and my friends would constantly brag about just how well optimized and user friendly their iphones were  I was never one to delve deep into unlocking Androids  true potential and being a power user  but I wasn t a grandma either 

Fast forward to 2020  I hear about the iphone 12 and its return to the iphone 4 design  which was my absolute favorite looking iphone   I was never a fan of the  rounded  iphones   This  combined with the fact that my S8 was not only coming on 3 years old now   the iphones and Galaxy series of phones cost about the same  made me switch 

  THOUGHTS  

I got my new Iphone 12 pro about 3 days ago 

  Cons  

I power it on and start setting everything up  I m a little disappointed by the screen resolution and detail  but it s not a major step down from my S8  Another big factor that contributed toward me switching was the fact that Apple decided to add widgets  I was a bit surprised in the fact that there is no Alarm clock or Email widget  but i ll make due  Another feature that disappoints me is the fact that there is no dedicated  back arrow  on the bottom right of the screen like with androids  It s either gesture controlled or a you have to reach to the top left of the screen to return somewhere  Something I did with my old S8 that greatly improved speeds was turn off unnecessary animations  like apps opening      A feature i m not sure is available on Apple products   

  Pros  

When I first took the phone out of the box  I was immediately impressed by the phones weight and build  This thing truly feels like it can take a beating and then some  The true tone display is very nice and color accuracy is impressive  The camera  as expected  is absolutely stunning  I took my first night mode picture last night and im blown away by the clarity and resolution a phone camera is able to reach  Snaps on snapchat look crystal clear  Granted  this is mostly due to the fact that Snapchat is well optimized for iphones   and zooming in no longer blurs pictures to the extent my older Androids did  Having long term software support is also another massive plus  The phone is not only remarkably faster  but the battery life is muuuuuch better than my old S8  Obviously  this is going to be the case no matter which new phone you get when you compare it to an old one though  Imessage is awesome and I love the animjoi feature as well  Lastly  Iphones tend to hold their value pretty well  which is really nice

  Overall Impressions  

The iphone 12 pro is an amazing phone  I love its new throwback design along with its true tone display and impressive camera  However  there was something homey about Android  Something I can t quite put my finger on that I miss  Maybe I need more time with my iphone and get more familiar with its features and quirks  as it s only been about 3 days  But overall im very excited with my switch  10  Years of Android ownership  Just switched to iphone 12 Pro  My thoughts first impressions",iphone,long time user phone due affordability customization first flagship galaxy immediately fell love design overall functionality friend family would would always stay true android upgraded galaxy right left college point little bit upset android still optimized snapchat social life started sky rocket much time spent app year later switch galaxy loved killer year awesome camera lightning fast amazing customization ui overall enjoyment would always look fence though see apple friend would constantly brag well optimized user friendly never one delve deep unlocking android true potential power user grandma either fast forward hear return design absolute favorite looking never fan rounded combined fact coming year old galaxy series phone cost made switch thought got new pro day ago con power start setting everything little disappointed screen resolution detail major step another big factor contributed toward switching fact apple decided add widget bit surprised fact alarm clock email widget make due another feature disappoints fact dedicated back arrow bottom right screen like android either gesture controlled reach top left screen return somewhere something old greatly improved speed turn unnecessary animation like apps opening feature sure available apple product pro first took box immediately impressed phone weight build thing truly feel like take beating true tone display nice color accuracy impressive camera expected absolutely stunning took first night mode picture last night im blown away clarity resolution camera able reach snap snapchat look crystal clear granted mostly due fact snapchat well optimized zooming longer blur picture extent older android long term software support also another massive plus remarkably faster battery life muuuuuch better old obviously going case matter new get compare old one though imessage awesome love animjoi feature well lastly tend hold value pretty well really nice overall impression pro amazing love new throwback design along true tone display impressive camera however something homey something quite put finger miss maybe need time get familiar feature quirk day overall im excited switch year ownership switched pro thought first impression

417,"This is directed at people who prefer using cases and screen protectors coming from an average user who isn t doing a lot of outdoor or extreme activities  

Given that there are 2 3 lens on the 11 and 12 s the whole camera unit of the phone takes up more surface area and sticks out from the body of the phone  there s more of it at risk of scratches and breaking  I know most cases lift up the phone enough so that the lens don t lay flat on a table  but is that enough 

I m coming from a single lens phone and over the years of use I have wiped away smudges with my fingers and clothes without any thought  but something about the size of the camera unit on current phones makes me think I may need to take the extra precaution   I mean  nobody with a DSLR would leave the lens uncovered all the time  and while it is bigger and more expensive  a phone undergoes way more daily use for the average person  

These products are not very expensive  but it raises the question about their quality and if they cause distortion to the image  Because then the trade off of increased protection but decreased usefulness wouldn t be worth it

460,"Never thought this day would come as I ve been on android  Galaxy S2 4 6 8 Pixel 2 3  since I had a 3GS  Hopefully this post can be helpful for those who are looking to switch from android to apple

I was planning on upgrading from my pixel 3 and was disappointed with the pixel 5  Google always had a clean android software  which enticed me to try out the pixels  The big downside of pixels is the hardware and quality control  Luckily I have never had to return any of the pixels I ve owned but you ll see tons of threads from unlucky pixel owners having to send back brand new phones due to issues

I decided to go with the 11 pro after I picked one up for a good price in my area  I ve had it for just under a week now and thought I d share my experience 


Things I miss about the pixel android 

Always on display 
I feel like this is something apple users just won t understand unless they ve had a chance to experience it  When I m busy doing something and my pixel was out of my reach  it was nice to be able to glance at the screen to see if I had any notifications without having to pick up my phone

Notifications 
Granted I m still getting used to apple s system but I just found notifications on android to be more simple and uncluttered  I liked being able to snooze a notification so that I could deal with it an hour later

Widgets 
iOS has come a long way and I enjoy iOS 14 and the customization that it came with  Gives users more freedom and creativity with their home screens  which was one of the reasons I didn t choose an iPhone before

Fingerprint scanner 
Now I know Face ID is technologically more advanced than a fingerprint scanner  But pixel s scanner was so quick and placed perfectly  It also doubled as a notification pull down so you could bring down your notifications from any app by swiping down on the scanner  It was an efficient way instead of having to swipe down with your finger every time



Things I love about the iPhone 11 Pro 

iOS 
Man  is the iPhone just buttery smooth  Everything just works together  There s no lag or hiccups  It s quick and the animations are nice to look at

Apps 
I ve known that a lot of the apps just work better on iPhones and now I can truly enjoy it  It feels smoother and more cohesive than some apps on android

Screen 
My god the screen on this is absolutely gorgeous  Looks crystal clear  brighter than my pixel  and texts look sharp  I don t even mind the notch as most apps are designed to hide it  But this screen is just fantastic and it s one of the best parts of this phone  I know it doesn t have a 90hz display but neither did my pixel so I m not affected by it

Apple ecosystem 
I used AirPods 2 with my pixel and while it worked as a Bluetooth device  it wasn t anything special  On my 11 pro  I love how every time I open the AirPod case  it connects instantly and shows the battery level  I know there are apps on android that mimic this feature but it s nowhere near smooth or clean as how apple does it with their chip

Battery 
The battery has been amazing so far  The fact that iPhones perform this well with a smaller battery than most high end android phones is pretty remarkable  I start work at 9 and usually with the pixel I m at about 60  by 1pm but I m consistently staying around 85  on the 11 pro with the same usage


TLDR 

I m definitely happy with the fact that I jumped ship to apple  There are some things I miss from the pixel android experience but I ve come across more pros since switching to the 11 pro  Also I didn t mention the cameras because yes  pixel used to be superior but iPhones have caught up significantly and sometimes performs better in some situations  I also love having the wide angle lens  which wasn t an option on my pixel

Hope this helps out people who are in similar situations with android and are thinking about getting an iPhone  First iPhone since the 3GS",iphone,never thought day would come galaxy pixel since g hopefully post helpful looking switch apple planning upgrading pixel disappointed pixel google always clean software enticed try pixel big downside pixel hardware quality control luckily never return pixel owned see ton thread unlucky pixel owner send back brand new phone due issue decided go pro picked one good price area week thought share experience thing miss pixel always display feel like something apple user understand unless chance experience busy something pixel reach nice able glance screen see notification without pick notification granted still getting used apple system found notification simple uncluttered liked able snooze notification could deal hour later widget io come long way enjoy io customization came give user freedom creativity home screen one reason choose fingerprint scanner know face id technologically advanced fingerprint scanner pixel scanner quick placed perfectly also doubled notification pull could bring notification app swiping scanner efficient way instead swipe finger every time thing love pro io man buttery smooth everything work together lag hiccup quick animation nice look apps known lot apps work better truly enjoy feel smoother cohesive apps screen god screen absolutely gorgeous look crystal clear brighter pixel text look sharp even mind notch apps designed hide screen fantastic one best part know hz display neither pixel affected apple ecosystem used airpods pixel worked bluetooth device anything special pro love every time open airpod case connects instantly show battery level know apps mimic feature nowhere near smooth clean apple chip battery battery amazing far fact perform well smaller battery high end phone pretty remarkable start work usually pixel pm consistently staying around pro usage tldr definitely happy fact jumped ship apple thing miss pixel experience come across pro since switching pro also mention camera yes pixel used superior caught significantly sometimes performs better situation also love wide angle lens option pixel hope help people similar situation thinking getting first since g

465,"I am planning on upgrading my Samsung Galaxy S9  to the new iphone 12 pro  I am debating on which pro model to get  the regular one or the Max 

I tend to lean towards larger phones as my S9  has a 6 2 inch screen  The regular iphone 12 pro seems to be almost the same size as my S9  with the pro Max almost having a 7 inch screen  If I would choose today I would go for the pro max but I am worried that the phone might be too large  I have a 12 9 inch iPad pro I would just use this if I need a large screen  I don t really use my phones one handed so I am not worried about that  I have rather small hands and I am worried it will be uncomfortable to hold 

I plan on keeping this phone for at least 4 years so I m not sure if the pro max offers additional benefits over the regular pro model except a larger battery  Battery life is one of the main reasons I am switching as the S9  is just abysmal

That s a difference of 1 4    probably imperceptible in actual use  The UI is also laid out at the same scale for both devices  375 points wide   so buttons and icons will appear the same size as well 

A lot of people have been thinking of the 12 mini as a new size of device  somewhere between the original SE and the 8 SE2  But in terms of the interface and user experience  it s really more like a modified 8   with slimmer bezels and a screen that goes edge to edge vertically

505,"Last year  the iPhone 11 dramatically improved the camera by introducing Night Mode and Deep Fusion and in my opinion  pretty much caught up with Pixel phones  So  I was pretty excited to see if Apple made any drastic improvements to the camera performance  especially in low light  So  I went ahead and bought an iPhone 12 Pro to find out  After shooting a bunch of photos in the city at night  here are my thoughts 

I only shot handheld and didn t use any third party apps  Also  in most places  I took the same photo with my iPhone 11 Pro and my Pixel 4 XL to see how it compared to the older generation  It s possible to get much better photos on a tripod as shutter speeds are slower at night  but most of us aren t walking around with tripods on a normal night  so I just wanted this test to reflect the normal experience 

 Here are the photos for reference   https   youtu be JQ 8L2AyI14 t 116   video with side by side comparison 

Here is a  Google Drive folder  https   drive google com drive folders 1I55p2swJvxZJ7J Lwo_cWAK3XWwOBbXS usp sharing  with all original photos 

When shooting with the main wide angle camera  in most cases  the photos from the 11 Pro looked identical to the 12 Pro and I had to double check the folders multiple times because I myself was getting confused while going through everything  The photos on the 12 Pro are generally a bit brighter with slightly more details in the shadows  But you could easily fool me by increasing the exposure slightly on the 11 Pro  When comparing with the Pixel 4XL  I noticed the Pixel tends to take slightly cooler shots with a bit more contrast  and in my opinion it s a bit better  Both the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro lean a bit more towards warmer tones overall 

The ultra wide camera is where the differences start to become more apparent  The 11 Pro doesn t have night mode on the ultra wide  which leads to almost unusable photos in low light unless you use a longer shutter with a third party app  The 12 Pro has the same camera  but due to night mode  the difference is night and day  Because the sensor isn t as big as the main camera  even with night mode  the photos are pretty mediocre  I d say use this lens in low light with a stand or if you have no other option  The Pixel 4XL doesn t have an ultra wide camera  so no comparisons here 

Apple is being very sneaky with the night mode on the 2x lens  I was under the impression that the telephoto camera also had night mode  But when I looked at the matadata  I saw that the aperture was at 1 6 on the 12 Pro and 1 8 on the 11 Pro  which means the iPhones use the primary camera and then digitally zoom in for the 2x zoom in most cases  This is pretty misleading on Apple s end  While the Pixel 4XL also switches back to the primary camera in extreme cases  it still uses the 2x camera most times  The photos from the iPhone 12 Pro and 11 Pro at 2x are usable and the quality is quite close to the Pixel as the primary camera has a bigger sensor  But  when I take photos at 5x  things become pretty clear  The Pixel outperforms both iPhones by quite a bit margin 

In the iPhone 12  Apple also introduced night mode to portrait mode  I tested this in a controlled setting on all three phones  The Pixel zoomed in when switching to portrait mode and had a lot of noise in the photo  The edge detection was fine  but not that impressive  especially around the hair  The iPhone 11 Pro did a pretty good job  but because it doesn t have night mode in portrait mode  the photos aren t as bright  Also  I noticed that edge detection was not as good as the iPhone 12 Pro  The iPhone 12 Pro did a fantastic job in this department  Even though I was backlit  it was able to fill the light thanks to night mode and the slightly bigger aperture  The bloom from the lights behind me was reflected in a pretty realistic way and the edges also looked pretty natural thanks to LIDAR 

When I switched to the front camera  the differences got much smaller  Both the 11 Pro and the 12 Pro look almost identical in terms of quality and edge detection as there s no LIDAR sensor on the front  The Pixel did pretty well here and I prefer the wider angle of the Pixel  Edge detection isn t perfect here either  but I like the cooler colours  None of the phones are perfect when taking portraits using the front camera in low light and it really comes down to personal preference 

One big issue I have with Apple s cameras is the lens flare I got in almost all my photos with lights directly facing the camera  It led to a lot of dots where there were multiple lights  which can be pretty distracting  I hope Apple fixes this in the future generations either through hardware or software improvements 

  Should you upgrade if you have an 11 Pro   

If you currently have an iPhone 11 Pro  I don t think you should upgrade to the 12 Pro as the low light performance is almost identical on two of the 3 cameras  The ultra wide angle really benefits from Night Mode  so if that s something you really care about  only then I d recommend upgrading  However  if you have a phone older than the 11 series  this upgrade is definitely worth it  Last year was a big jump in quality for Apple  and this year  it s only gotten better 

I m very curious to see how the iPhone 12 Pro Max performs when it comes out  It s going to come with a better primary sensor and a different telephoto camera  I tested the iPhone 12 Pro night mode against the 11 Pro and Pixel 4 XL",iphone,last year dramatically improved camera introducing night mode deep fusion opinion pretty much caught pixel phone pretty excited see apple made drastic improvement camera performance especially low light went ahead bought pro find shooting bunch photo city night thought shot handheld use third party apps also place took photo pro pixel xl see compared older generation possible get much better photo tripod shutter speed slower night u walking around tripod normal night wanted test reflect normal experience photo reference http youtu jq l ayi video side side comparison google drive folder http drive google drive folder p swjvxzj j lwo cwak xwwobbxs usp sharing original photo shooting main wide angle camera case photo pro looked identical pro double check folder multiple time getting confused going everything photo pro generally bit brighter slightly detail shadow could easily fool increasing exposure slightly pro comparing pixel xl noticed pixel tends take slightly cooler shot bit contrast opinion bit better pro pro lean bit towards warmer tone overall ultra wide camera difference start become apparent pro night mode ultra wide lead almost unusable photo low light unless use longer shutter third party app pro camera due night mode difference night day sensor big main camera even night mode photo pretty mediocre say use lens low light stand option pixel xl ultra wide camera comparison apple sneaky night mode x lens impression telephoto camera also night mode looked matadata saw aperture pro pro mean use primary camera digitally zoom x zoom case pretty misleading apple end pixel xl also switch back primary camera extreme case still us x camera time photo pro pro x usable quality quite close pixel primary camera bigger sensor take photo x thing become pretty clear pixel outperforms quite bit margin apple also introduced night mode portrait mode tested controlled setting three phone pixel zoomed switching portrait mode lot noise photo edge detection fine impressive especially around hair pro pretty good job night mode portrait mode photo bright also noticed edge detection good pro pro fantastic job department even though backlit able fill light thanks night mode slightly bigger aperture bloom light behind reflected pretty realistic way edge also looked pretty natural thanks lidar switched front camera difference got much smaller pro pro look almost identical term quality edge detection lidar sensor front pixel pretty well prefer wider angle pixel edge detection perfect either like cooler colour none phone perfect taking portrait using front camera low light really come personal preference one big issue apple camera lens flare got almost photo light directly facing camera led lot dot multiple light pretty distracting hope apple fix future generation either hardware software improvement upgrade pro currently pro think upgrade pro low light performance almost identical two camera ultra wide angle really benefit night mode something really care recommend upgrading however older series upgrade definitely worth last year big jump quality apple year gotten better curious see pro max performs come going come better primary sensor different telephoto camera tested pro night mode pro pixel xl

I have two ways apple could have brought back MagSafe while doing things better than competitors 

A  reverse wireless charging 
Apple could have brought back MagSafe by having magnets like it currently has  and allowing reverse wireless charging so users can charge their iPhones and AirPods on their iPhones itself  They can use magnets to better position the phone to allow maximum efficiency and good software integration  

B  the current MagSafe charger sticks to the phone and it is not possible to release the charger with one hand  This is no better than a wired charger which by itself would be more power efficient and cheaper  Everyone knows that  A better way apple could have done this is by using powered magnetisation  That way you could just tap the iPhone and have it release itself from the charger so that it is one handed  Or in case your phone hits 100  then the phone should de magnetise and allow you to lift the phone with one hand  Or even use Siri by saying  Hey Siri  I m done charging  and she de magnetises the iPhone so that you can lift it off  
That would be real innovation  Not this crap of using the exact 20W charger with this exact magsafe adaptor to get 15W charging speed which isn t even the best  
There are Chinese flagships that have nearly 30W wireless charging  And apple is late enough to the party as it is  because the iPhones with wireless charging were iPhone 8 and X from 2017  Surely 3 years is enough to innovate a better way 

Of course this is just my opinion and  mind you  I m an Apple fan boy  but this whole MagSafe thing that apple is going ga ga over is not nearly as impressive as everyone thinks it is  

Opinions  Making MagSafe better  ",iphone,two way apple could brought back magsafe thing better competitor reverse wireless charging apple could brought back magsafe magnet like currently allowing reverse wireless charging user charge airpods use magnet better position allow maximum efficiency good software integration b current magsafe charger stick possible release charger one hand better wired charger would power efficient cheaper everyone know better way apple could done using powered magnetisation way could tap release charger one handed case hit de magnetise allow lift one hand even use siri saying hey siri done charging de magnetises lift would real innovation crap using exact w charger exact magsafe adaptor get w charging speed even best chinese flagship nearly w wireless charging apple late enough party wireless charging x surely year enough innovate better way course opinion mind apple fan boy whole magsafe thing apple going ga ga nearly impressive everyone think opinion making magsafe better

563,"As a future Mini owner I just couldn t wait for the battery tests as this is the the only thing we don t know about this device

So I took the stats from the 11 Pro and the 11 Pro Max and simulated it for the 12 and 12 Mini as the situation is similar  same screen just a different size  similar resolution  etc 

TLDR

The Mini should be around 10 percent worse than the regular 12  in  phonebuff com  https   phonebuff com  tests

THIS IS WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 5G WHICH IS IRRELAVNT FOR 99  OF THE USERS

    11Pro battery size is 76 7  of the 11ProMax
    11Pro screen size  is 82 0  of the 11ProMax
    11Pro battery life is 84 8  of the 11ProMax
    
    12Min battery size is 79 1  of the 12
    12Min screen size  is 79 7  of the 11ProMax

According to this 

the 12Min 12 is   bigger   than 11Pro   11ProMax  in   battery size  

And also

the 12Min 12 is   smaller   than 11Pro   11ProMax  in   screen size  

So the ratio of battery life of 12Min 12 should be a   higher   than this of 11Pro   11ProMax

It should be higher by at least 3 4   2 5  for difference in battery and there is also the screens size ratio difference 

So my guess is around 10 11  worse than the regular 12  I simulated the battery life of the 12 Mini",iphone,future mini owner wait battery test thing know device took stats pro pro max simulated mini situation similar screen different size similar resolution etc tldr mini around percent worse regular phonebuff http phonebuff test without taking account g irrelavnt user pro battery size promax pro screen size promax pro battery life promax min battery size min screen size promax according min bigger pro promax battery size also min smaller pro promax screen size ratio battery life min higher pro promax higher least difference battery also screen size ratio difference guess around worse regular simulated battery life mini

642,"So would it be possible for Apple to sometime down the line after going wireless to completely remove buttons and introducing something like the iPhone 7 8 SE home button for the power  volume buttons and and ringer  So you could completely remove the protrusions and and just have a tiny LCD without backlight  like on a kindle  just to highlight the points of pressure

654,"Hi everyone 

I m going to upgrade from my galaxy s10e but I am a little undecided between these two phones  I have a strong interest in the camera quality because I do a lot of hiking and climbing and sometimes I can t bring my main camera with me 

Which one is the best  As a whole I mean the main sensor  the ultrawide  the front facing camera  for portrait mode  for night mode  for video taking  smoothness  autofocus and general magagement of exposure   I will never go back with Samsung as its camera create almost fake colours  everything it s shiny and brilliant  and creates super smooth faces  

From my understanding the iphone 11 was far better than the pixel 4  and the iphone 12 is better than the pixel 5  Unfortunately I don t have the money for the iphone 12    But what about the pixel 5  

There are noticeable improvements for videos or the iphone remains too far ahead  The night sight in ultrawide of the pixel it s so far ahead than the normal ultrawide of the iphone 11  Plus I would prefer the size of the pixel but it s not a big deal  

 amp  x200B 

My budget should be 500  or a bit more  in Italy I can find the pixel for 620 and a good certified refurbished iphone for 620 650  The former should go down for black friday  the latter maybe won t at all  

Any thoughts  This is my first post  sorry if I ve done some mistakes 




EDIT  I can equally enjoy stock android and iOS even if I have already an ipad 
I ve found  given that are both good  
 Iphone  wide angle without night mode  selfie camera without night mode  only flash and you are blown away   selfies with light have very realistic details but edges of figures often aren t well detected from the background
 pixel  wide angle is more close  selfie camera is MUCH more close  selfies are a little smooth  videos are ok but with wide angle loose compared to iphone 

I m so torn 
 Iphone pro 11 here in Italy is 1000  for a new one and 800 for a good refurbished  so it s too much even with black friday  pixel 5 vs iphone 11  which camera would you choose   as a whole ",iphone,hi everyone going upgrade galaxy e little undecided two phone strong interest camera quality lot hiking climbing sometimes bring main camera one best whole mean main sensor ultrawide front facing camera portrait mode night mode video taking smoothness autofocus general magagement exposure never go back samsung camera create almost fake colour everything shiny brilliant creates super smooth face understanding far better pixel better pixel unfortunately money pixel noticeable improvement video remains far ahead night sight ultrawide pixel far ahead normal ultrawide plus would prefer size pixel big deal x b budget bit italy find pixel good certified refurbished former go black friday latter maybe thought first post sorry done mistake edit equally enjoy stock io even already ipad found given good wide angle without night mode selfie camera without night mode flash blown away selfies light realistic detail edge figure often well detected background pixel wide angle close selfie camera much close selfies little smooth video ok wide angle loose compared torn pro italy new one good refurbished much even black friday pixel v camera would choose whole

This is a follow up to my previous thread  After two silver iPhone 12 Pros were scratched  I just took the last graphite iPhone 12 Pro they had  When I got home  I went to another Apple Store via train because I didn t wanna spend money taking an Uber there again and they had MagSafe for sale 

Anyway  once I got to the Apple Store  I let the lady know about my previous experiences today  A lot of run around between the specialist and her manager  They were so nice by the way  I love Apple lol best customer experience ever  the screen protector installer tool that they use is terrible though 

I asked the lady if I can take before after pictures  they offered to write me a note about the iPhone being scratched during the process so I can make a return when they restock for silver whether I go to either store 

So  I took some brief  before  photos 

Meanwhile the lady wiped the machine  she was so gentle with the whole process  And even took her time  I watched  She gave me the iPhone afterwards and I looked at the same areas where the previous iPhones were scratched  And yep  there it was  Not as bad though  Probably the PVD doing some work 

I only saw one scratch at the Apple Store after the application  I took a video while I was there to capture the scratch to show them  but apparently there was another scratch on the other side that I ve yet to see  This other lady that the specialist brought out was the one that pointed it out since they both needed to see this 

Anyway  not only were the polished stainless steel scratched  but I noticed there s a paint imperfection on the back glass  it looks like a spec of dust distorting the shade  I am so unlucky   

I m still surprised that their new plastic tool scratched the PVD coating on the graphite

Today  I got a new iPhone 12 Pro in silver with a belkin screen protector installed by the Apple Store  When I got home  I noticed a savage scratch near the mute switch and several severe scratching on the middle portion of the band scattered around 

I called the store and was sent to a supervisor  and basically we were going to check out if what I said was credible  I went back and it looked like the iPhone couldn t have scratched because of the plastic screen protector installer 

The supervisor managed to find one last iPhone 12 Pro in silver  He let me inspect it and it was flawless  gave it to the supervisor  then he passes it to the specialist that installs the screen protector 

The specialist was pretty smooth with his process  but when he removed the iPhone from the tray  he noticed something strange  He showed it to the supervisor and he tried to wipe something off the stainless steel band  and I saw a glimpse of it  It was way more severe than what I got  it was vertical scratches this time  it looked like a claw dug into it 

Now  they don t have anymore silver iPhone 12 Pro  but they let me have the graphite and would let me switch if they were ever back in stock  I didn t bother getting a screen protector even if the graphite stainless steel is PVD  Didn t wanna risk the last graphite iPhone 12 Pro either lol

I m just facepalming at myself for sarcastically saying to the supervisor   imagine if this iPhone got scratched as well   and it actually did  I am so unlucky 

At least the supervisor said they ll speak to the higher ups  The supervisor and specialist were really nice  But I m just imagining all the people who got the screen protector by Apple 

I looked at the tool  and it s pretty clean and smooth    when you look at it  you don t see how it could possibly scratch  but I get the polished steel is just delicate  maybe

754,"3 years ago I made the switch from my iPhone 6  previously owned the 4 before that  to the google pixel 2   A big part of that switch for me was the camera   Apple just didn t seem to care about their cameras before the iPhone X  and the pixel had great features and was a flagship 

I am back to apple and plan on staying put now that I have had a good taste of both sides   Here is my honest take on the comparison between the 2   There are just a couple things that I still feel android is doing better 

I m going to start with the downsides first and then boast about the iPhone  there is way way more good than bad to share 

               

CONS 

  Siri is not as good as  ok google    Google assistant can take multiple commands  is able to answer more complex questions  and just seems more accurate overall 
HOWEVER  Although android is known for its extreme customization  Siri surprisingly seems to be far more customizable with shortcuts and using them can make her a powerhouse over google for certain tasks 

  widgets  this was a big draw for me with iOS 14 as android was already utilizing them for sometime   iOS widgets look far more beautiful       but that is just it  they are more of a show piece that lack actual function or interaction   iOS widgets more or less just display information   On Android I can interact with the widgets right on the Home Screen without ever opening the actual app  iOS opens the full app  every time I touch a widget  I can t simply scroll through lists  control music in Spotify  or scroll the stocks on the stock market app  I have to open the entire app to see more   This seems a little counterintuitive  if it is always going to open the full app then I may as well just use the normal icon and open it 

  camera app quick access   on my pixel I simply double tap the power button to open the camera app   This means that as i am pulling it out of my pocket I can already be opening the camera app to capture a fleeting moment   Or  I can be in another app and double tap the power button to open camera  iOS looses points for not being as quick and efficient in this instance 

  finger print scanner on the back of the phone  As I pull the phone out of my pocket i put my finger on the scanner and it is not just unlocked but opened to the homescreen when i bring it out of my pocket 

  System settings   this is just different   I did like on android that you can swipe down from the top and access system settings very quickly  where as iOS requires searching f or the settings app  This is more of and adjustment to get used to  not a huge end of the world 

   edit  no ability to turn location services on and off quickly   Swiping down from the top on android allows you to quickly turn off location tracking services for all apps or turn it back on   You think apple would have this since they pride themselves on privacy  and yes android asks the same questions apple for every app and giving it permission to access your location 

   edit  swipe gesture  on android swipe left anywhere on your screen in any app and it acts as a back button  no needing to reach up to the corner to press a back arrow or other icon like on iOS  
               

PROS 

  the iPhone 12 pro is freaking beautiful  the build quality feels like nothing else and the display is vibrant and accurate   Although the lack of 120hz is a big downer on a premium phone in 2020 

  iOS feels far more smooth and integrated  I personally just prefer the look and function of it over android   It really feels more intuitive to how I use a phone   As well simple things like sharing or copying an image is way faster and smooth on iOS   Same with downloading images or marking them up with the iOS app   On android I had to download an image  search for it  then send it to a friend   iOS literally lets you copy and paste images into messages or emails 

Face ID passwords   although i could use my fingerprint for biometric passwords on android  something about the smoothness of Face ID for logging into apps feels far more intuitive and like i am living in the future 

  the cameras on the iphone 12 are beautiful  And the video quality is stunning  As a videographer by profession  I can actually see this camera replacing my pro camera when on family vacation  And the ability to play with third party lenses from companies like  moment  really excites me 

  the processing power of the a14 bionic chip   I can play the best games and do video editing smoothly on this phone  Yesssss

  Apps  It s amazing how many apps feel like they are designed for IOS first and that android feels more like an after thought   Even Facebook   My Facebook app would always alert me of a new notification but when I went to check the notification list it would not update without repeated refreshing   I even reinstalled the app and did a factory reset on my phone  and this problem persisted   On iOS      It works smoothly as it s supposed to   As well there are literally some apps that are only iOS 

  Customization   Android users love to harp on apple for not allowing full customization       The more I customized my android the slower and more unreliable it became  my camera app would freeze and crash often  one app hijacked my Home Screen and I literally had banner ads on my regular Home Screen   I ended up just using default settings on the phone to reduce problems    iOS is far more stable because of apples regulations  and honestly IOS offers customization in the places I care about most which are mainly aesthetics  

  Shortcuts app  I am amazed at what can be done with this app   And it truly is a level of customization and integration that I can t say I found on android  that is stable anyways    

  iMessage  My wife and my friends are all apple  and they would text me videos the took with their phones  But because I am not on iMessage  videos would be hot garbage and I would have to remind them to send me videos via Facebook messenger    In fact even sending media from android to android can look like garbage   Last week I watched my 2 friends share a 2 5GB video in literally 10 seconds via airdrop to one another  super fast and easy  Now that I am back  I can share a receive videos in high quality 

  health app   very cool insight for tracking health and awesome that 3rd party apps can integrate with it to keep all info in one spot  Especially if you plan on an Apple Watch  

  integration with other apple products   I forgot how nice it was to connect and share with my MacBook so easily  And to airdrop so fast with my wife  

  keyboard   being able to hold the space bar to move the text icon     edit  I stand corrected that this feature is indeed on android  I just never noticed 

  Adaptive brightness  this is small  but my pixel was just not accurate with this and I was always adjusting brightness for my environment   So far the 12 pro is bang on

764,"I  like many of you  had been on the fence for weeks  Coming from the 8  I wanted a better camera  and better battery life  but I also wanted a small phone  For me  it was the choice between the 12 pro and the 12 mini  because the 12 pro  at 128 gb  offered improvements in the same physical size over the 12  while the mini had inferior hardware compared to the Pro  but a much better size  

I preordered the Pro and it came in yesterday  It is a stunning phone in gold  Beautiful creamy white gold back  with shiny gold borders 

But it feels huge  I m a woman  and a men s size S   USA   in gloves  I could only use the phone with two hands  and it felt heavy  It was difficult to go from the top of the screen to the bottom in smooth motions  Even worse  it felt unwieldy to hold and I realized that I would probably have to buy AppleCare  an expense I usually avoid  because it feels too easy to drop  A smaller phone would be more secure in my hands  bag  and pockets 

My hands started hurting and I realized it just wasn t worth it  The better cameras and battery life aren t worth a phone that hurts to use most of the time  Based on reviews I ve read  camera performance on the 12 and 12 pro are so similar that I m sure the mini won t represent as large a tradeoff as I had imagined  

So I m sending it back  It s flawless  of course  and hopefully it can be a good replacement device for someone in the future  Just wanted to share my thoughts in case it helps any of you  I m returning my iPhone 12 Pro for the Mini ",iphone,like many fence week coming wanted better camera better battery life also wanted small choice pro mini pro gb offered improvement physical size mini inferior hardware compared pro much better size preordered pro came yesterday stunning gold beautiful creamy white gold back shiny gold border feel huge woman men size usa glove could use two hand felt heavy difficult go top screen bottom smooth motion even worse felt unwieldy hold realized would probably buy applecare expense usually avoid feel easy drop smaller would secure hand bag pocket hand started hurting realized worth better camera battery life worth hurt use time based review read camera performance pro similar sure mini represent large tradeoff imagined sending back flawless course hopefully good replacement device someone future wanted share thought case help returning pro mini

788,"If you are on Verizon s Unlimited Loyalty plan or the shared 5GB 10GB plans  you might get some rather confused information from Best Buy employees and even a few Verizon Store reps  I expect it might apply to Apple Store employees as well after a talk with Verizon today  To put it simply  you do not need to switch to the new unlimited plans to get 5G unless you want mmwave 5G now   

After having some issues activating an iPhone 12 this morning at Best Buy  which turned out to be a bad SIM card  multiple people at Best Buy and a nearby Verizon store and the local Best Buy Verizon rep all commented the problem was probably because my Unlimited Loyalty plan did not include 5G    Again  it was just a bad SIM card and let it go at the time since it got activated and they said it would still be fine as a LTE only device until I decided to change plans   

This evening though  I called Verizon and got a very knowledgeable support person who laughed and said it was not the first time that had come up today   He then called up my account data and confirmed I was properly provisioned for non mmwve 5G  which my phone was actually using at the time of the call   He then stressed that almost all of the plans had been upgraded to include 5G as part of the roll out  including the loyalty and old legacy grandfathered ones   What you do not get is mmwave or the stuff such as bundled free Apple Music  Disney  etc   For me  mmwave is useless and my  90 month  with tax   very fast  unlimited loyalty plan for two lines is a much better deal than  130 or  140  before tax  to have something I cannot use plus a  10 music subscription   It is even a better deal since I now know that the conventional 5G in the El Paso Las Cruces area really is faster than LTE

860,"Somebody please take my idea and make it real  

A Magsafe control pad for games on iPhone  I have something similar to below but I always found the clamp a bit rubbish on my 11 Pro Max since the clamp has to be open fully to fit my phone 

Imagine a controller similar to the one in the image but 

  The Magsafe magnet holds it in place rather than a clamp 
  The NFC chip contains the bluetooth handshake to connect the controller to the phone  not sure if this is possible on iPhone or not  
  The controller has a sizeable battery that could act as a power bank and charge the iphone through magsafe to keep you gaming for longer  

All we would need then is a good game streaming service on iOS

I was wondering  what are y all s thoughts on storage for your iPhone  Do you want to 64 128  or 256 gb phone  What s your reasoning for more storage 

At some point in today s cloud world does it make sense to just get the iCloud storage or use google photos to upload your pictures  Instead of getting more storage and paying   50  100 

iCloud pricing is  

 99 cents for 50gb
 2 99 for 200gb
 10 for 2TB

I m trying to think about my storage options for my phone  The main things that take up space for me are photos  texts  and that s pretty much it  And I realize I could pay for 50gb of storage to hold my text messages or just delete them after a year  I also keep my iPhone for 3 years at a time  

What do y all do for storage  Thanks 

Edit  just wanted to say thanks for all your responses   I appreciate it     Your Thoughts on Storage ",iphone,hi everyone wondering thought storage want gb reasoning storage point today cloud world make sense get icloud storage use google photo upload picture instead getting storage paying icloud pricing cent gb gb tb trying think storage option main thing take space photo text pretty much realize could pay gb storage hold text message delete year also keep year time storage thanks edit wanted say thanks response appreciate thought storage

890,"Here s a few cases I ve picked up in prep of my Pac Blue iPhone 12 pro I m grabbing tomorrow  

1 	Pitaka MagEZ case w  compatible wallet
2 	Knock off Silicon Case
3 	Knock off clear case
4 	PEEL clear case

Bonus  Watch series 6 I picked up today in matching blue

  Obviously I ll have to wait and see how it works with the phone but first impressions   

1 	Pitaka case is great love the feel and is a nice design but the magnet it comes with isn t too strong and I m not 100  comfortable with how it works in conjunction with the wallet as it feels a bit flimsy on the back  Also cost for both is high almost not worth it considering you could get apple s products for maybe 20  more  
2 	Silicon case is nice and though I haven t seen the apple ones I m sure theirs is better but the cost was like  13 so not bad for price  But no MagSafe obviously but it does come with all it s appropriate holes so   
3 	Knock off clear case is my personal favorite so far since I want to show off the new color and the borders have a nice blue to them too which may be nice considering the reports of the very shiny very fingerprint ready sides of the pro 
4 	PEEL case is about double the Knock off clear case   35 ish  but it s  super  thin a good mm thinner than the other clear case so if you re into the really sleek almost imperceptible case look this is a good choice  Though I m worried that this won t actually protect the phone any more than without the case

I bought a generic case from Amazon for  12 99  Elago Liquid Silicon  compared to the  49 Apple Silicon case  I was worried that I wouldn t get my Apple one soon enough  so I bought both  This is my first time opting for the official Apple case  but I was pretty shocked at how decent the generic was  Maybe I shouldn t be so surprised that buying Apple accessories is mostly for the name  but I would say that that is especially the case  ha   here 

   BUT THEN    I realized that the generic doesn t appear to have any magnetic capability   The Apple case sticks to my fridge and can get picked up by a magnet  while the generic is totally unresponsive   Will this diminish the effect of accessories sticking to the phone   Will this case fit securely without magnetic stickiness   These might be things to consider when looking for a 12 case
