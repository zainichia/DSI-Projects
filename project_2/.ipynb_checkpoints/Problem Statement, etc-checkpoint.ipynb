    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Property business is a high value and productive business; and for most people, it will be the biggest financial decision of their lives. In this project we aim to create and iteratively refine a regression model to predict the price of a house based on its features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting a reliable and accurate prediction of the sale price of a house is extremely useful for both sellers and buyers, as it gives them a benchmark of how much a certain property should cost, given the features it has. This can help to prevent over or under selling, and can help both prospective owners and sellers reach their goals more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also hope to better understand which features of a property will potentially increase the sale price of a house, as well as what features may hurt the prospects of a house sale. This information is extremely valuable to prospective sellers, as they will then be able to carry out targeted improvements to their home before trying to sell it."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is carried out in   main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes changing datatypes to the appropriate ones, handling missing data and checking for outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we explore each feature, and study their correlations to each other as well as to the target variable (Sale Price). We also study their distributions. Depending on the analysis, we may drop certain features, or we may also create interaction terms between correlated features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Modelling and Predictions**\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a baseline model that will carry out predictions before any feature engineering is done. This will allow us to iteratively improve our feature engineering process, as we will be able to see if any feature engineering will improve our predictions or potentially make it less accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Evaluation of Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use relevant metrics to evaluate our model and predictions, and we also interpret the results of our data analysis and modelling\n",
